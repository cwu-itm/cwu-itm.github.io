    <h1>I am Muhammet Sukru Kalayci</h1>
    <p>I am an international student from Turkey. This is my almost fourth year living in the United States, and my third quarter here at Central Washington University after graduating from Shoreline Community College with a Criminal Justice degree. I love watching sports and being in them, I played professional soccer in Europe and have been in an assistant manager role for multiple amateur soccer clubs.</p>
    <h2>My portfolio includes my blog posts about digital environment and design, and also multiple design challenges about UX on figma.</h2>
