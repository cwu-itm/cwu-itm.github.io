               <h2>Module 1.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
            <p>As my initial blog post in this class I think it is important for me to start out by saying that while I think I have a basic understanding of the concepts of systems engineering, I really have struggled to be able to pull it all together in a meaningful way. With that being said, and after doing the reading for this section of the module, I feel that I am not much better off. The concepts make sense, but seem like they are vague, maybe intentionally. I hope as time passes I get a better grip on the concepts as a whole, but this first week has been a blur and a real challenge to retain a useful amount of information that would make me feel like I am ready to have a thoughtful discussion on systems engineering overall.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>The model-based systems engineering is definitely complex, but I do think I understand why it appears to be considered “essential learning for any modern-day Systems engineer” (Holt, 2023) based on how it breaks down all of the processes into manageable chunks and groups them into more easily comprehendible areas that allow you to focus on a plan for each section. The variety of model visualizations shown and described in the text do help, but I think one of my biggest challenges is likely to be the transition from spoken language type notations to the SysML. I understand that the model itself needs to be built with the stakeholder in mind, but until I understand it better myself, I am not sure I am ready to know what the stakeholder really needs to see or which views will be the easiest for them to understand.</p>
            <h3>Expanding The Search For Knowledge</h3>
            <p>In hopes to get a bit more understanding, I ventured out in the CWU library to see if maybe other books would be easier to understand, and I did find a few. Once such book, Systems Engineering Principles and Practice had a great first chapter about systems engineering overall, and the definition of systems engineering that they used, “The function of systems engineering is to guide the engineering and development of complex systems” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020) when combined with their breakdown of guide being “To guide is defined as “to lead, manage, or direct, usually based on the superior experience in pursuing a given course” and “to show the way.” This characterization emphasizes the process of selecting the path for others to follow from among many possible courses – a primary function of systems engineering.” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020).</p>
            <p>I also really liked the section on examples of engineered complex systems as it provided a more basic explanation of the system, inputs, processes, and outputs that I could grasp in a way that made me feel like I was not completely lost, but it did make if feel a bit oversimplified, which may have been intentional by the authors to get the readers brain just thinking about what other systems around their day to day lives have as far as the engineering that went into them before becoming what they are today.</p>
            <h3>Going Further</h3>
            <p>Another book that I found via the CWU library was Systems Engineering : A Systemic and Systematic Methodology for Solving Complex Problems. Early in chapter 2 the author describes that system engineers “do not produce systems, they transform an operational need into a description of system performance parameters and a system” and then goes on to say that they “assist in the subsystem construction and subsystem tests, perform system integration and system test, but other personnel actually construct the systems” (Kasser, 2019) which makes sense to me, but still does not quite clarify the vast variety of different descriptions of systems engineers and system engineering concepts that each book that I delved into seemed to present as the correct way to do things.</p>
            <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
            <p>I am going to cut this blog short and take the grading hit because I am just not as prepared as I should be but also do not want to not get something submitted. I really do hope that by spending more time re-reading a lot of the first chapters of a few of these books, and spending some time digging through the expanse of videos available on you tube on the subject that I might get a better grasp on the concepts all around and be able to understand it enough to have better results on the next blog post.</p>

               <h2>Module 1.2 Blog Post</h2>

            <h3>Initial Thoughts On Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>The life cycle model made much more sense to me than the previous sections. I think this is likely because I could relate it directly to my experience in aviation. This is especially true when reading about project life cycles, program life cycles and product life cycles near the beginning of chapter 4 in our reading. I can directly relate my experiences with older airframes and newer airframes and how each has a somewhat finite product life cycle, but within that overall product life cycle, there are hundreds, if not thousands of project and program life cycles that go into the final product as well as adding modifications and improvements that may come and go and have their own distinct life spans within the overall life span of the complete airframe.</p>
            <h3>Linear Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>This also ties in directly to the 3 life cycle models we are supposed to learn about and discuss this week as in airframes I think all 3 life cycle models exist many times over and a clearly defined based on what the end product subset is. The easiest model to understand for me, also happens to be the first one discussed, and that is the linear life cycle model. As our reading discusses, this is where “each Stage is executed in a specific order and each Stage is executed after the completion of the previous Stage. There is typically no route to go back to a previous Stage” and “where the original needs are well specified and not likely to change. Also, the Product being developed and the Technologies being used are typically well understood. In terms of the Project, the resources are easily managed and readily available and the timeframe for such Projects tends to be short” (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>I think the linear model, while easy for me to understand, is probably the least common that I have come across in my aviation past, as there are not many things in aviation that are not constantly being improved upon and have a single linear course of action from beginning to end. The one exception might be system software for some core components where once it’s a working component, it really does not need to be re-accomplished unless the component itself is modified or replaced. So, in these cases, a linear model may make sense as a part of the overall project life cycle. This is explained well by Kossiakoff et al. in their discussion on linear software life cycles when they state that “the linear software development model category consists of a sequence of steps, typically with feedback, resulting in a software product. Linear development models work well in environments with well-understood and stable requirements, reasonable schedules and resources, and well-documented practices” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020).</p>
            <h3>Iterative Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>After linear life cycles, our reading goes into iterative life cycle models. This definitely represents a significant amount of the life project life cycles that I am used to dealing with in aviation, where “instead of a single pass through the Life Cycle Stages, there are several passes through the Stages, which are known as iterations. Iterative Life Cycle Models have been used successfully for decades and have seen a resurgence in the last two decades with the widespread use of Agile techniques” (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>While it does seem like frequently, “Agile” is the catchphrase of the day and is combined with all sorts of follow on descriptions, I think it is a solid concept when it comes to life cycles where being able to rerun processes through steps and improve outcomes or modify the overall end product to fit the needs of the stakeholders better just seems like a win-win for everyone in the process, as long as you have the time and resources to follow through with it.</p>
            <p>Iteration in itself is not a difficult concept to grasp, and all of my reading so far has put a slightly different spin on it that has all helped me come to a better accumulated understanding of what the process may entail in a variety of systems engineering ideas. One additional example is described by saying “Iteration is needed to accommodate stakeholder decisions and evolving understanding, account for architectural decisions/constraints, and resolve trades for affordability, adaptability, feasibility, resilience, etc” (INCOSE, 2015).</p>
            <p>Without going too far off the path here in this section of discussion, I also found the concepts of defining a life cycle for assets interesting when Holt mentions “the Asset Life Cycle will be closely related to the System Life Cycle, as an example of an Asset is a System. However, the scope of an Asset is far wider, as an Asset can be anything that has value to an organization and, therefore, may also be people, infrastructure, equipment, data, and so on” (Holt, 2023). The mention of people as assets really peaked my interest, and as I continued to read though and came to the section on iterative life cycles, I found my mind wandering into the idea that in my current role in human resources, people really are an asset that also go through a life cycle within the organization, and while linear would be easiest to through at the idea of people as assets, I think many organizations are trying to develop people in a more iterative or agile fashion and not just putting them on a linear path from hiring to retiring.</p>
            <h3>Incremental Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>Before I lose sight of the goal here, let me move on to the third life cycle model discussed in our reading, which is the incremental life cycle model. This really was a challenge for me to separate from iterative, as it appears on the surface to share so many of the same ideas and concepts as a life cycle model. This paragraph from our reading helped me get to a better understanding when it explained that “The incremental Life Cycle Model results in the System being deployed in an incremental fashion, rather than as a single release as in the case of the linear Life Cycle Model. This is a clear advantage as the final System can be seen to be working and the System is deployed, albeit in a reduced form, compared to how it was relatively early in the Project. The incremental Life Cycle Model is, therefore, very good for very long Projects where some functionality of the System is required before the end of the Project” (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>When I think of this model it reminds me, possibly incorrectly, of the current state of how many online games are developed, or really game development in general. Where more and more games are released as a version of paid “early access” when the game is not in is final form and not all of it has even been designed or possibly even thought of yet, and as the early access continues, the game goes through an incremental life cycle with partial releases incrementally expanding the game until its final stage which may come much later down the road. </p>
            <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
            <p>Using this game development theory also helps me to wrap all three life cycle models under one umbrella and see how changes have happened over time. Over the years things have changed, and in reality, early video games like the ones released on cartridges, had a very linear life cycle development process where they went from concept to design to production to release, and then that was it. And then later you had games that went through more of an iterative process, where the entire game was released, but then there were iterations and fixes that were deployed. Then finally you reach the current method frequently used, which is what I discussed above where the game is developed and released in increments and follows what appears to be a much more incremental life cycle than the games of the past.</p>
