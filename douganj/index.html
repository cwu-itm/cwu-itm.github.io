               <h2>Module 1.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
            <p>As my initial blog post in this class I think it is important for me to start out by saying that while I think I have a basic understanding of the concepts of systems engineering, I really have struggled to be able to pull it all together in a meaningful way. With that being said, and after doing the reading for this section of the module, I feel that I am not much better off. The concepts make sense, but seem like they are vague, maybe intentionally. I hope as time passes I get a better grip on the concepts as a whole, but this first week has been a blur and a real challenge to retain a useful amount of information that would make me feel like I am ready to have a thoughtful discussion on systems engineering overall.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>The model-based systems engineering is definitely complex, but I do think I understand why it appears to be considered “essential learning for any modern-day Systems engineer” (Holt, 2023) based on how it breaks down all of the processes into manageable chunks and groups them into more easily comprehendible areas that allow you to focus on a plan for each section. The variety of model visualizations shown and described in the text do help, but I think one of my biggest challenges is likely to be the transition from spoken language type notations to the SysML. I understand that the model itself needs to be built with the stakeholder in mind, but until I understand it better myself, I am not sure I am ready to know what the stakeholder really needs to see or which views will be the easiest for them to understand.</p>
            <h3>Expanding The Search For Knowledge</h3>
            <p>In hopes to get a bit more understanding, I ventured out in the CWU library to see if maybe other books would be easier to understand, and I did find a few. Once such book, Systems Engineering Principles and Practice had a great first chapter about systems engineering overall, and the definition of systems engineering that they used, “The function of systems engineering is to guide the engineering and development of complex systems” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020) when combined with their breakdown of guide being “To guide is defined as “to lead, manage, or direct, usually based on the superior experience in pursuing a given course” and “to show the way.” This characterization emphasizes the process of selecting the path for others to follow from among many possible courses – a primary function of systems engineering.” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020).</p>
            <p>I also really liked the section on examples of engineered complex systems as it provided a more basic explanation of the system, inputs, processes, and outputs that I could grasp in a way that made me feel like I was not completely lost, but it did make if feel a bit oversimplified, which may have been intentional by the authors to get the readers brain just thinking about what other systems around their day to day lives have as far as the engineering that went into them before becoming what they are today.</p>
            <h3>Going Further</h3>
            <p>Another book that I found via the CWU library was Systems Engineering : A Systemic and Systematic Methodology for Solving Complex Problems. Early in chapter 2 the author describes that system engineers “do not produce systems, they transform an operational need into a description of system performance parameters and a system” and then goes on to say that they “assist in the subsystem construction and subsystem tests, perform system integration and system test, but other personnel actually construct the systems” (Kasser, 2019) which makes sense to me, but still does not quite clarify the vast variety of different descriptions of systems engineers and system engineering concepts that each book that I delved into seemed to present as the correct way to do things.</p>
            <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
            <p>I am going to cut this blog short and take the grading hit because I am just not as prepared as I should be but also do not want to not get something submitted. I really do hope that by spending more time re-reading a lot of the first chapters of a few of these books, and spending some time digging through the expanse of videos available on you tube on the subject that I might get a better grasp on the concepts all around and be able to understand it enough to have better results on the next blog post.</p>
