               <h2>Module 1.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
            <p>As my initial blog post in this class I think it is important for me to start out by saying that while I think I have a basic understanding of the concepts of systems engineering, I really have struggled to be able to pull it all together in a meaningful way. With that being said, and after doing the reading for this section of the module, I feel that I am not much better off. The concepts make sense, but seem like they are vague, maybe intentionally. I hope as time passes I get a better grip on the concepts as a whole, but this first week has been a blur and a real challenge to retain a useful amount of information that would make me feel like I am ready to have a thoughtful discussion on systems engineering overall.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>The model-based systems engineering is definitely complex, but I do think I understand why it appears to be considered “essential learning for any modern-day Systems engineer” (Holt, 2023) based on how it breaks down all of the processes into manageable chunks and groups them into more easily comprehendible areas that allow you to focus on a plan for each section. The variety of model visualizations shown and described in the text do help, but I think one of my biggest challenges is likely to be the transition from spoken language type notations to the SysML. I understand that the model itself needs to be built with the stakeholder in mind, but until I understand it better myself, I am not sure I am ready to know what the stakeholder really needs to see or which views will be the easiest for them to understand.</p>
            <h3>Expanding The Search For Knowledge</h3>
            <p>In hopes to get a bit more understanding, I ventured out in the CWU library to see if maybe other books would be easier to understand, and I did find a few. Once such book, Systems Engineering Principles and Practice had a great first chapter about systems engineering overall, and the definition of systems engineering that they used, “The function of systems engineering is to guide the engineering and development of complex systems” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020) when combined with their breakdown of guide being “To guide is defined as “to lead, manage, or direct, usually based on the superior experience in pursuing a given course” and “to show the way.” This characterization emphasizes the process of selecting the path for others to follow from among many possible courses – a primary function of systems engineering.” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020).</p>
            <p>I also really liked the section on examples of engineered complex systems as it provided a more basic explanation of the system, inputs, processes, and outputs that I could grasp in a way that made me feel like I was not completely lost, but it did make if feel a bit oversimplified, which may have been intentional by the authors to get the readers brain just thinking about what other systems around their day to day lives have as far as the engineering that went into them before becoming what they are today.</p>
            <h3>Going Further</h3>
            <p>Another book that I found via the CWU library was Systems Engineering : A Systemic and Systematic Methodology for Solving Complex Problems. Early in chapter 2 the author describes that system engineers “do not produce systems, they transform an operational need into a description of system performance parameters and a system” and then goes on to say that they “assist in the subsystem construction and subsystem tests, perform system integration and system test, but other personnel actually construct the systems” (Kasser, 2019) which makes sense to me, but still does not quite clarify the vast variety of different descriptions of systems engineers and system engineering concepts that each book that I delved into seemed to present as the correct way to do things.</p>
            <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
            <p>I am going to cut this blog short and take the grading hit because I am just not as prepared as I should be but also do not want to not get something submitted. I really do hope that by spending more time re-reading a lot of the first chapters of a few of these books, and spending some time digging through the expanse of videos available on you tube on the subject that I might get a better grasp on the concepts all around and be able to understand it enough to have better results on the next blog post.</p>

               <h2>Module 1.2 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Initial Thoughts On Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>The life cycle model made much more sense to me than the previous sections. I think this is likely because I could relate it directly to my experience in aviation. This is especially true when reading about project life cycles, program life cycles and product life cycles near the beginning of chapter 4 in our reading. I can directly relate my experiences with older airframes and newer airframes and how each has a somewhat finite product life cycle, but within that overall product life cycle, there are hundreds, if not thousands of project and program life cycles that go into the final product as well as adding modifications and improvements that may come and go and have their own distinct life spans within the overall life span of the complete airframe.</p>
            <h3>Linear Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>This also ties in directly to the 3 life cycle models we are supposed to learn about and discuss this week as in airframes I think all 3 life cycle models exist many times over and a clearly defined based on what the end product subset is. The easiest model to understand for me, also happens to be the first one discussed, and that is the linear life cycle model. As our reading discusses, this is where “each Stage is executed in a specific order and each Stage is executed after the completion of the previous Stage. There is typically no route to go back to a previous Stage” and “where the original needs are well specified and not likely to change. Also, the Product being developed and the Technologies being used are typically well understood. In terms of the Project, the resources are easily managed and readily available and the timeframe for such Projects tends to be short” (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>I think the linear model, while easy for me to understand, is probably the least common that I have come across in my aviation past, as there are not many things in aviation that are not constantly being improved upon and have a single linear course of action from beginning to end. The one exception might be system software for some core components where once it’s a working component, it really does not need to be re-accomplished unless the component itself is modified or replaced. So, in these cases, a linear model may make sense as a part of the overall project life cycle. This is explained well by Kossiakoff et al. in their discussion on linear software life cycles when they state that “the linear software development model category consists of a sequence of steps, typically with feedback, resulting in a software product. Linear development models work well in environments with well-understood and stable requirements, reasonable schedules and resources, and well-documented practices” (Kossiakoff et al., 2020).</p>
            <h3>Iterative Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>After linear life cycles, our reading goes into iterative life cycle models. This definitely represents a significant amount of the life project life cycles that I am used to dealing with in aviation, where “instead of a single pass through the Life Cycle Stages, there are several passes through the Stages, which are known as iterations. Iterative Life Cycle Models have been used successfully for decades and have seen a resurgence in the last two decades with the widespread use of Agile techniques” (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>While it does seem like frequently, “Agile” is the catchphrase of the day and is combined with all sorts of follow on descriptions, I think it is a solid concept when it comes to life cycles where being able to rerun processes through steps and improve outcomes or modify the overall end product to fit the needs of the stakeholders better just seems like a win-win for everyone in the process, as long as you have the time and resources to follow through with it.</p>
            <p>Iteration in itself is not a difficult concept to grasp, and all of my reading so far has put a slightly different spin on it that has all helped me come to a better accumulated understanding of what the process may entail in a variety of systems engineering ideas. One additional example is described by saying “Iteration is needed to accommodate stakeholder decisions and evolving understanding, account for architectural decisions/constraints, and resolve trades for affordability, adaptability, feasibility, resilience, etc” (INCOSE, 2015).</p>
            <p>Without going too far off the path here in this section of discussion, I also found the concepts of defining a life cycle for assets interesting when Holt mentions “the Asset Life Cycle will be closely related to the System Life Cycle, as an example of an Asset is a System. However, the scope of an Asset is far wider, as an Asset can be anything that has value to an organization and, therefore, may also be people, infrastructure, equipment, data, and so on” (Holt, 2023). The mention of people as assets really peaked my interest, and as I continued to read though and came to the section on iterative life cycles, I found my mind wandering into the idea that in my current role in human resources, people really are an asset that also go through a life cycle within the organization, and while linear would be easiest to through at the idea of people as assets, I think many organizations are trying to develop people in a more iterative or agile fashion and not just putting them on a linear path from hiring to retiring.</p>
            <h3>Incremental Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>Before I lose sight of the goal here, let me move on to the third life cycle model discussed in our reading, which is the incremental life cycle model. This really was a challenge for me to separate from iterative, as it appears on the surface to share so many of the same ideas and concepts as a life cycle model. This paragraph from our reading helped me get to a better understanding when it explained that “The incremental Life Cycle Model results in the System being deployed in an incremental fashion, rather than as a single release as in the case of the linear Life Cycle Model. This is a clear advantage as the final System can be seen to be working and the System is deployed, albeit in a reduced form, compared to how it was relatively early in the Project. The incremental Life Cycle Model is, therefore, very good for very long Projects where some functionality of the System is required before the end of the Project” (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>When I think of this model it reminds me, possibly incorrectly, of the current state of how many online games are developed, or really game development in general. Where more and more games are released as a version of paid “early access” when the game is not in is final form and not all of it has even been designed or possibly even thought of yet, and as the early access continues, the game goes through an incremental life cycle with partial releases incrementally expanding the game until its final stage which may come much later down the road. </p>
            <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
            <p>Using this game development theory also helps me to wrap all three life cycle models under one umbrella and see how changes have happened over time. Over the years things have changed, and in reality, early video games like the ones released on cartridges, had a very linear life cycle development process where they went from concept to design to production to release, and then that was it. And then later you had games that went through more of an iterative process, where the entire game was released, but then there were iterations and fixes that were deployed. Then finally you reach the current method frequently used, which is what I discussed above where the game is developed and released in increments and follows what appears to be a much more incremental life cycle than the games of the past.</p>

            <h3>Human-centered design</h3>
            <p>Human-centered design appears at first to mean a variety of things, and at the center of it all seems to be the consolidated focus on designing the UX with the end user in mind throughout the design process. I think the IDEO guide put it best when they stated “Human-centered design is a unique approach to problem solving, one that can occasionally feel more like madness than method—but you rarely get to new and innovative solutions if you always know precisely where you’re going. The process is designed to get you to learn directly from people, open yourself up to a breadth of creative possibilities, and then zero in on what’s most desirable, feasible, and viable for the people you’re designing for (IDEO.org, 2015). While the whole statement really help to solidify the concept of human centered design, I feel that the last sentence is really the key. Attempting to home in on what is desirable, feasible and viable throughout an iterative design process help to guide the final UX design in a way that will hopefully ensure that the end product meets or exceeds your design audience’s needs.</p>
            <p>Our reading on Jakob’s law also reinforces this concept and “encourages designers to follow common design conventions, enabling users to focus more on the site’s content, message, or product. In contrast, uncommon conventions can lead to people becoming frustrated, confused, and more likely to abandon their tasks and leave because the interface does not match up with their understanding of how things should work” (Yablonski, 2020). Which really correlates to the IDEO guides mention of how desire plays such a role in human centered design, and also into the concepts of Fitt’s law which was “established as a model for understanding human movement in the physical world before the invention of the graphical user interface, but it can also be applied to movement through a digital interface” (Yablonski, 2020).</p>
            <p>Not only it is important to takes this concept into account when initially designing the UX, it is just as important if not more important when accomplishing a drastic redesign of a well-established and possibly well liked UX design. Yablonski describes a vivid example of this with the  “2018 redesign of Snapchat. Instead of gradually introducing changes through slow iteration and extensive beta testing, the company launched a major overhaul that dramatically changed the familiar format of the app by combining watching stories and communicating with friends in the same place. Unhappy users immediately took to Twitter and expressed their disapproval en masse. Even worse was the subsequent migration of users to Snapchat’s competitor, Instagram” (Yablonski, 2020).</p>
            <h3>IDEO Field Guide vs ISO 9241-210</h3>
            <p>While I do find the human-centered design concepts in the IDEO Field Guide to be quite good and easy for me to grasp, it is important to also consider the ISO 9241-210 information as another source of guidance in this area. It does seem like both the IDEO field guide and ISO 9241-210 revolve around the same basic ideas of human, but the IDEO field guide appears to learn more towards a possibly emotional tie in, with what is desirable for the user, where the ISO 9241-210, still focused on human centered, leans towards more physical aspects of the interaction. This statement from the ISO 9241-210 reading really highlights the core aspects to me, “The fundamental prerequisite is that the system, product, or service design must be based on a comprehensive understanding of the users, tasks, and working environment. However, theoretical knowledge that can be gained at the desk through research (keyword: desk research) is insufficient. You require the direct involvement of users in the design and development of the solution. You must collect feedback, through various methods, from users regarding the design solutions. This feedback is then incorporated into the revision of the solution. Therefore, considering users’ requirements, a product, system, or service is iteratively created, and the overall UX is optimized” (Franz & Kauer-Franz, 2024).</p>            
            <h3>Perception and Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>When thinking about human-centered design, one key factor according to our reading is to ensure we account for perception and how it affects the user’s interaction with the design we are making. This can be a challenge since perception is vastly different for everyone, and even the same user’s perception can change over time. Johnson highlights this by saying that “Perception is active, not passive. Think of your perceptual senses not as simply filtering what comes to you but rather as reaching out into the world and pulling in what you need to perceive. Your hands, your primary touch sensors, literally do this, but the rest of your senses do it too.” Which he then further explains how “If you are looking on a website for a campus map, your eyes and pointer-controlling hand are attracted to anything that might lead you to that goal. You more or less ignore anything unrelated to your goal” (Johnson, 2020)</p>
            <p>Everyone does this, and what we perceive can shift based on what we are looking to get out of the experience, which in the end can make it a real challenge for UX designers to achieve their end goals. I think this is why it is key to involve as many of your target user in the design iteration process as possible to ensure you are doing everything you can to provide a good user experience for your end user. Having a variety of test subjects involved in the process can be extremely beneficial since “Past experience can bias our perception by “priming” our perceptual systems to detect certain objects and events as well as “priming” them not to detect other objects and events. Repeated perception of an event over a short interval can cause habituation, increasing the chances that we will miss later occurrences of the event. With long-term experience, we develop frames for familiar situations that make us perceive things that aren’t there or miss things that are” (Johnson, 2020). The past experiences will vary from person to person, so the more variety you have interacting with your UX in the design stages the more problems you can solve in advance.</p>                        
            <p>Johnson also discusses visual hierarchy, which is can be related to perception, but also needs to be considered on its own as to how the UX design is configured. There are many standard layouts for things, and how we group those elements together can impact the user experience so Johson mentions that “Visual hierarchy should actually be called “information hierarchy” because the basic design principle applies more broadly than just visual design. Organizing information hierarchically, using headings, subheadings, and other groupings to define sections and subsections, can help even sight-impaired and blind users find what they are looking for” (Johnson, 2020)</p>
            <p>I think that visual hierarchy is also easier to understand in the framework of Hick’s law, which I have to be honest, when I first started reading about Hick’s law, I admit the math was a bit off-putting but getting further into the reading I realized it was really just about simplifying things enough, but not too much, so the user can actually use the design as intended. This appears to be where Hick’s law comes into play, and our reading confirms that “Hick’s law is a key concept in user experience design because it’s an underlying factor in everything we do. When an interface is too busy, actions are unclear or difficult to identify, and critical information is hard to find, a higher cognitive load is placed on users. Simplifying an interface or process helps to reduce the mental strain, but we must be sure to add contextual clues to help users identify the options available and determine the relevance of the information available to the tasks they wish to perform. It’s important to remember that each user has a goal, whether it’s to buy a product, understand something, or simply learn more about the content” (Yablonski, 2020).</p>
            <p>Although I do happen to agree with this concept, and if I were to design something it would likely be for a western audience, there is something to be said for the fact that different cultures have a different idea of what a good or useful design might be, and so it would be very important for the intended audience to be considered heavily as part of the human centered design approach. Alberto Ferreira discuss this at length in his book Universal UX Design: Building Multicultural User Experience, and I think he really hit the target when saying “internationally localized websites are routinely redesigned and adapted to local expectations, often without proper usability testing, prompting the question: are localized websites taking into account user expectations at all? The fact that Chinese and Japanese UI design differs so much from prevailing design tendencies in both America” (Ferreira, 2017).</p>
            <p>Miller’s law also dives into visual hierarchy and the idea of chunking when is described in our reading as “grouping related content and objects together and using design elements such as color, scale, dividers, and spacing to make these groups visually distinctive from other groups. Users can then scan the content, identify the information that aligns with their goal(s), and consume that information to achieve their goal(s) more quickly. By structuring content into visually distinct groups with a clear hierarchy, we can align the information we present with how people evaluate and process digital content” (Yablonski, 2020).</p>
