            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Today's era of hyper connection and speed is giving us more complex systems than ever everything from intelligent cities and driverless cars to cloud-native applications and connected health. Not just are these systems technologically more sophisticated, but they are embedded in intricate social, regulatory, and environmental contexts as well. Consequently, traditional engineering practices reliant on linear logic and document dense methodologies are not keeping up. This is where model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and systems thinking comes in and are surfacing as impactful, complementary methods that allow problem solvers and engineers to deal with complexity. This article explores how MBSE and systems thinking allow us to have an integrated, responsive, and a sustainable way of engineering. They are not mere processes, but rather an example, one that allows us to leave behind on the spot problem-solving and instead create active, collaborative, and impact solutions. </p>
            <h3>System Thinking and MBSE</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking is a systems-based analysis methodology that focuses on how components of a system engage with each other and how systems function over time and within larger systems. You could say this system has existed since the beginning of mankind's creation of systems in general and becoming more of a common term and getting acknowledged in the 20th century, more specifically in the 1960s. At its essence, systems thinking accepts important principles such as feedback cycles, cause and effect, and emergent action phenomena that could not be learned by examining bits and pieces of the system. For example, optimizing traffic throughput in a metropolitan area isn't merely a function of adding highways; it entails studying public transport availability, commute patterns, urban planning regulations, and even the algorithms used to pair ride-partners. It's a dynamic system with interrelatedness and indirect effects.</p>
            <p>In the reading of Systems Engineering Demystified, Jon Holt emphasizes complexity quite often and that systems thinking is a practical way in handling the complexity that often occurs. He also mentions communication and understanding quite often as well which together these three were named Three Evils of System of Engineering. This is a systems theory view, where components can be explained only in terms of their relationship to one another, not in isolation (Holt, 2023). Holt’s first chapter talks about these quite heavily and even is seen in the second chapter. These hold true for professionals and even students, systems thinking evokes a critical self-awareness. It tries to have us tackle all these issues.</p>
            <p>Consider the aerospace industry, where systems are notoriously intricate and safety critical. NASA, for example, employed MBSE in the design and integration of its Artemis lunar missions. Models allowed engineers to simulate interactions between propulsion, navigation, communication, and environmental subsystems documenting potential failures before physical prototyping. According to NASA, using integrated models across subsystems improves reuse, evaluation speed, and overall system understanding—particularly for high-stakes space exploration initiatives (NASA, 2021). This saved costs significantly, improved reliability, and sped up cross-departmental collaboration. NASA is just one example of MBSE being adopted industry-wide automotive, defense, telecom, and even medical where systems must change fast but retain interoperability and regulatory compliance. This shows the worth and versatility of MBSE and system thinking in these environments.</p>
            <h3>Synergy and SysML</h3>
            <p>Where systems thinking provides us with the conceptual structure, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides us with the tools to execute on that structure. MBSE replaces outdated, document-based approaches with formal models capturing the structure, behavior, requirements, and constraints of a system. This makes MBSE and systems engineering possibly feel like their own categories. This is not true, and their strengths are important especially when they paired together. Systems thinking determines what we need to know the dynamic complexity, patterns, and larger context. MBSE determines how we communicate and maintain that knowledge using established, flexible models. </p>
            <p>One of these is something called SysML (Systems Modeling Language). According to an article I found and read SysML is “It provides a visual language for representing complex systems, including their structure, behavior, and information flows. SysML is derived from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) but tailored specifically for systems engineering needs.” (Zuken, 2024). Implementing this and any others I have not mentioned has the ability to help organizations be more efficient, reliable, and effective in their outcomes.</p>
            <p>A practical smart building system may involve user behavior, weather data, energy efficiency requirements, and automation rules. Systems thinking ensures you consider the whole context; MBSE (via SysML) enables you to break it down into views, simulate behavior, and validate your design versus all functional and stakeholder requirements. Together, these techniques enable transparency, flexibility, and stakeholder alignment across all phases: from idea to retirement.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>While useful, MBSE and systems thinking have their drawbacks. To begin with, they both offer a steep learning curve and how they are having to integrate the systems without ruining workplace systems and cultural systems. Models are as good as the inputs, assumptions, and data that fuel them. Poorly designed models can mislead rather than inform. There is also the risk of model over-reliance where teams become more interested in maintaining models whole rather than engaging with real feedback. This is all somewhat solvable but is heavily reliant on the people working behind the implementation.</p>
            <p>Another issue being seen is the maintenance of the models as this is constantly changing technology quickly develops which also affects system thinking together. Finally, compatibility will proceed to be another issue because there is so many methods and systems that are useful or may feel needed, but as mentioned above the people who work to implement and work out the smaller issues is really the deciding factor in MBSE and system thinking working well.</p>
            <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
            <p>As I have continued to learn about system thinking and MBSE, I have remarkably changed in the way I approach problems since I wanted to absorb useful information even at a base level. I tend to narrow my thought process and now I look for the whole problem/system to understand the issue. The major thing is understanding the Three Evils I learned from Holt and how this does not only apply to this topic, but also how it can apply to almost any system related in real life and while I most likely will not fully dive into using these in most real life situations, even having the thought process in the back of my mind is important as well. The value of abstraction was quite fundamental as well in reshaping how I wanted to approach these problems. I am glad to learn and try to continuously understand these concepts as a student because system thinking and MBSE will continue to be a common part of the tech world, and I need to be prepared to face these in the future.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>MBSE and system thinking are extremely important and relevant because of the sheer amount of improvement they have when implemented correctly which makes sense because of the difficulty in being able to properly understand and implement them are so important which shows their worth afterwards. By embracing systems thinking, we shift our minds from linear problem-solving to pattern recognition and design in wholes. By using MBSE, we then possess the ability to translate that mindset into models that drive clarity, agility, and collaboration. To make systems smarter, safer, and more sustainable, we must shift from managing pieces to understanding wholes. The quicker we embrace that transition, the more we'll be ready to make the future efficient, yes, but impactful as well.</p>

            </header>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>When we think about systems engineers, it is easy to picture people building highly technical solutions rockets, infrastructures, software platforms. But systems engineering is not about building things. It is about building the right things, in the right way, for the right reasons, and guiding them through every stage of their evolution. This strategic, life cycle focused view is the bedrock of systems thinking and the engine of model-based systems engineering. In this blog, I will talk about the concept of the systems development life cycle, compare three common life cycle models linear, iterative, and incremental and reflect on why a life cycle perspective is crucial to the sustainability and adaptability of digital systems.</p>
            <h3>Understanding Life Cycle Thinking</h3>
            <p>The system's engineering life cycle is a structured framework that outlines the stages a system passes through from conception to retirement. According to Holt, a life cycle consists of a series of stages that describe how a system's evolution changes over time, and each stage provides a checkpoint for crucial decisions, such as whether to advance, rework, or retire a system (Holt 2023). The typical life cycle begins with the conception stage, which involves defining stakeholder needs and establishing the foundation for what you want the system to achieve for its purpose. The development stage focuses on designing solutions and validating them against those needs which may lead to a prototype for the next stage which is production. Production continues, during which the actual system is built and constantly tested to ensure it meets the original design purpose and specifications. Once the system is in place, it moves into utilization, where it operates in its intended environment. This often goes hand in hand with the support stage, where maintenance, updates, and user assistance are provided. Finally, the system reaches retirement, where it is decommissioned, disposed of responsibly, or replaced. These stages do not always unfold in the same sequence. How they are executed depends on the life cycle model selected, and each model has its strengths and limitations. </p>
            <h3>Life Cycle Models</h3>
            <p>The first life cycle model talked about was the linear model, sometimes called the Waterfall Model as a classic version, representing a simple step-by-step approach. In this model, one phase is completed fully before the next begins. It is a straightforward method that is best suited to projects with clearly defined requirements from the start. Because of its sequential nature, the linear model allows for strong documentation, milestone tracking, and easy oversight. However, it is not very flexible as any late changes in the process can cause issues and is not good for any projects seeking to go long term hence the name linear was given to it. </p>
            <p>In contrast, the iterative model breaks development into repeated cycles. Instead of completing the entire system in one pass, the team creates a working version, gathers feedback, and refines the system in subsequent iterations. Each loop builds upon the last, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation. This model shines in environments where requirements may evolve or where early feedback is essential to success. According to the Institute of Data, this method supports a strong “emphasis on flexibility, incremental development, and continuous improvement makes it a valuable approach for projects with evolving requirements and a need for collaboration.” (Institute of Data). That said, it does require ongoing stakeholder engagement and careful scope management to prevent the project from getting stuck constantly refining the details. </p>
            <p>Finally, the incremental model also divides the system into parts, but rather than looping back through entire development cycles, each increment adds a new piece of functionality. These pieces are planned and delivered in multiple phases that allows the system to gradually grow. With each increment, teams can test, receive feedback, and adapt future increments accordingly. However, some challenges can be earlier increments locking in structural decisions, architectural missteps in early development can be difficult to correct which makes premature decision making incredibly important. </p>
            <h3>Why Thinking in Life Cycles is Important</h3>
            <p>Life cycle thinking is important because it allows engineers to look beyond the present and to consider how systems will behave, interact, and transform over time. The first benefit of this perspective is the ability to design for change. A constricted, one-time approach may work in static environments, but digital systems rarely stay under fixed conditions. Whether it is adapting to new standards, integrating new components, or changing based on user feedback, design changes become more natural because of life cycle thinking. Modeling a system’s life cycle enables stakeholders to predict and plan for how systems will adapt, ensuring resilience and long-term functionality. </p>
            <p>Sustainability is another but it is a key point as well. Thinking in life cycles encourages the design of systems that are not only effective but also socially and environmentally responsible. This is apparent in an article I read where they talked about, “Commitment to sustainable manufacturing solutions enhances cost-effectiveness and supports a circular economy.” (Motion drives and controls). For digital systems, this can translate to energy-efficient design, responsible data handling, accessible user interfaces, and responsible decommissioning practices. These are extremely important to know and plan out because they can lead to digital waste, security vulnerabilities, or the loss of valuable institutional knowledge. </p>
            <p>Clear stakeholder communication also largely benefits from proper thinking of life cycles. MBSE frameworks rely on consistent modeling languages and ontologies to unify understanding. Stakeholders interact with visual, structured models that outline every stage of the system. This reduces ambiguity and helps everyone be one with expectations, making collaboration more productive overall.  </p>
            <p>Lastly, life cycle models help reduce risk. Anticipating system evolution, incorporating early validation, and being able to adapt constantly all contribute to catching potential problems before they become costly or dangerous. The iterative and incremental models are particularly helpful here, as they allow for constant testing and learning. </p>
            <h3>How MBSE Relates to Thinking in Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>Model-Based Systems Engineering enhances life cycle thinking by replacing static documents with dynamic, interconnected models. These models are more than just diagrams, they are living blueprints that evolve alongside the system. With MBSE, every requirement, component, interface, and behavior are represented in a way that supports consistency, traceability, and automation. Rather than capturing design decisions in isolated reports, MBSE integrates them into a cohesive framework. Engineers can visualize system behavior, define how components interact, and verify requirements all within a single environment. By embedding views such as structural breakdowns, interface definitions, and connectivity models into the life cycle, MBSE ensures that teams work with accurate, current, and actionable insights at every stage. </p>
            <p>This modeling approach also supports reuse. Well-constructed MBSE models can become libraries of components and configurations that future projects can adapt and build upon. This not only speeds up development but also promotes higher quality by drawing from proven designs. By making systems more transparent, flexible, and integrated, MBSE turns the life cycle from a theoretical framework into a practical, operational tool. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>All in all, thinking about life cycles is not just project timelines they are the story of how systems come to life, evolve, and retire. In systems engineering, understanding this story is critical. Whether you are creating software, infrastructure, or embedded systems, the life cycle model you choose will shape not only how your system is built, but how well it endures. With linear being straightforward but no flexibility, iterative focuses on feedback and constantly changing, and incremental balances constant updates for adaptability. Choosing wisely and properly with many more factors is important for the future vision of your system. </p>

               <h2 id="Module 2.1 Blog Post">Module 2.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In the world of technology where digital environments, systems, and products are being constantly created every day, you do not think about the philosophies behind the designs and everything, but they are made specifically for people in mind. Huma-centered design (HCD) is the act of designing digital systems based on how people think, interact, and feel about technology. This blog will address a variety of topics related to HCD from understanding the points of people are focused on the design of systems to the key UX laws because all these points are extremely important designing around human interaction in mind today as technology continues to constantly grow from new to upgraded designs. </p>
            <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
            <p>First, we need to understand why we create systems for people which is because humans process information differently than what you would obviously expect from a machine especially because people have selected perception, imperfect memory, and poor vision in general. We can classify this as limitations, but that is not a negative notation because it is optimization. This does not mean however that optimization is perfect for digital interfaces. This is why we need extra care for how our systems appear and a wonderful way to go about this is structures. Before we continue, we need to talk about the perspectives of ISO and IDEO’s Field Guide. ISO is about the users throughout the whole design and development process whereas, IDEO is a more flexible approach which focuses on empathy of the users by learning constantly about the emotions, behaviors, and needs. These two are good on their own, but I believe they could truly shine together as ISO would provide a powerful base in structure, while IDEO would lead in new directions with empathy from users.  </p>
            <p>In Designing with the Mind in Mind by Jeff Johnson, it is mentioned that “Perceiving structure in our environment helps us make sense of objects and events quickly... when people are navigating through software or websites, they do not scrutinize screens carefully and read every word. They scan quickly for information relevant to their goals.” (Johnson, 2020). This makes complete sense as you yourself must have experienced doing this recently and informs us when we see clustered systems we become overwhelmed we cannot focus on something specifically thus making us unable to act occasionally. This is called visual hierarchy and understanding this hierarchy is important because good designers understand this way of perception people have by showing empathy in their designs as well as other factors such as the users' goals or situational context depending on if they are in a hurry or not. Attention goes quite alongside this as well because of the fact our attention is limited and selective so leading users along is an important part of design as well. An example would be the distinct colors and shades that are utilized in design to help guide users to understand the interface and allow the user to not overlook crucial functions. </p>
            <h3>Jakob's Law</h3>
            <p>Now let us talk about the Laws of UX starting with Jakob’s Law. This law is about the expectations users started having about systems being either the same or similar. This expectation is what can lead to user frustration so being able to create a sense of familiarity with the systems is extremely important. This does not necessarily want the websites to look aesthetically the same, the only ask is consistency in how certain things are done like symbols such as the magnifying glass for a search option or when you are shopping online the shopping cart and the location of these symbols being in similar locations help users. This does not mean that everything is the same as mentioned in Laws of UX textbook they conclude, “Jakob’s law is not advocating for sameness in the sense that every product and experience should be identical. Instead, it is a guiding principle that reminds designers that people leverage previous experience to help them in understanding new experiences.” (Yablonski, 2024). Keeping this in mind when designing a digital interface is meant to allow the users to be productive through familiar systems and patterns instead of learning completely new ones while being a unique interface in other ways. </p>
            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <p>While Jakob’s Law was about familiarity, the next law Fitt’s Law is about making interactions easier for users. Fitt’s Law is the relationship between the time it takes to interact with an object from the distance away from the input method and the size of the object. (Yablonski, 2024). The reason this law is important is because it references our attention in how if certain objects are too small or in an obscure location, we immediately disregard the object even if it is a useful one at that, but the opposite holds true in the fact that an object too big or in an inconvenient location for other objects this causes issues and frustrations with the interface. The other issue is properly spacing out objects to fit a certain size on the interface, especially if it is on a smaller screen like mobile devices and the selector being your fingers. This is quite a simple law to understand, but extremely hard to perfect as there are many factors that need to be considered. </p>
            <h3>Miller's Law</h3>
            <p>Miller’s Law is stated that “The average person can hold only about seven items in their short-term memory, suggesting that concise communication is key for clarity and retention.” (Helio 2023). This simply broken down is that when users are required to remember long sequences or information without assistance, they are more likely to not commit to the task to make a mistake along the way. A solution to this is to provide smaller chunks of information and assistance with reminders of past information. This helps us understand to respect and understand the human brain and how it processes information and help support users with proper ways to communicate through the interface. </p>
            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p>Finally, the last law, Hick’s Law, is about making decisions simpler because of how the brain works when there are more choices available, the longer it takes. The benefits of this law and to always incorporate it into your system interfaces is “this principle in design optimizes decision-making, reduces cognitive load, and engages users effectively.” (Alpha.One 2024). This optimizes the experience for users and provides options for them to optimize the amount of information they can see. An example to use this law is a filter system in a site like Amazon where you have the search bar for a specific item and then within the page a filter that can go over the prices or brands you can see. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Design is all about the users and that will not change in time. In fact, this will continue to grow and evolve with more details and solutions to guide users by learning continuous learning of user's interactions. The strongest example of this is empathy for the users compared to perception and attention even though both are also indispensable. The understanding of cognitive loads and the wide number of emotions that can be felt when using their systems is critical in the design process and is also why I valued a balance in the ISO and IDEO perspectives. Overall, the design process is complex because of the range from easy details such as familiarity of symbols or layout to something about the size of fonts or symbols and the distance from other objects.  </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>When we think about a “usable” digital system we may think about how it looks and the layout of the system, but that is not all there is to a usable digital system. What really makes a system usable is efficiently constructing a system about the user's way of thinking, their behavior, and solving those problems. We need to properly understand the way the human brain functions from the user's memory, the habits they pick up, and the concept of mental shortcuts. With these concepts in mind the finished system minimizes the amount of cognitive effort needed. In this blog we will go over the principles behind this such as reducing complexity, giving clear pathways, and proper feedback to have users feel that their system is intuitive or usable. </p>
            <h3>Memory and Mental Models</h3>
            <p>The first time any user interacts with a new digital system they start by relying on their experience which leads to certain assumptions and then uses their mental models. An example of easy mental models is the Jakob’s Law or familiarity in symbols. How this works is like a trash can icon you see often which always represents a delete type of function or even the magnifying glass signifying the search tool. If these tools are not universal, our memory and mental models get confused and consume energy to reconfigure, causing frustration having to relearn everything. This is crucial for user interaction with the system because users make these decisions based off assumptions and if their assumptions are wrong from different symbols or placing a symbol in a different position from its universal position in most systems the increase in time and errors coincide with the change from user assumptions. Finally, the memory of users which is split into short term memory and long-term memory and building around both is important. The building around short term memory is the Miller’s Law which mentions people can hold give or take around seven items in their memory. Utilizing this law with chunking information can lead to long term memory being developed as well. Designing for long term is more difficult and is why it is not talked about as a law, but we can utilize the use and purpose of short term memory by constantly applying the use of short term memory we can eventually develop long term memory in our users by constantly promoting easier and quicker designs based off short term memory (Owen). This process is the safest way to promote both as complexity would develop errors and over simplicity would not help the memory of users when using the system interface. </p>
            <h3>Interface Consistency and System Feedback</h3>
            <img src="images/loading.jgep" alt="Loading Feedback Symbol" width="480" height="270">
            <p>Interface design consistency and system feedback are essential components for usable systems. Consistency has been mentioned already in the previous section where inconsistency will promote relearning and more energy than usual which can heighten the number of mistakes seen. Reducing this would be keeping universal symbols the same in every aspect from base design, location, size, and even colors. This sense of familiarity and trust is crucial for usability. Feedback is equally just as important. System feedback is when the system confirms an action the user has given which can be a confirmation message, a sound cue, a loading bar, or a mixture of these. These are important because the user may not fully know if they completed the action properly and may end up trying to repeat the action, even though the action was already registered the first time. This action of repeating can cause issues on both ends of the interaction which will lead to a lot of time consumed and a variety of mistakes along with it. Feedback can also relate to how memory works in using the system as mentioned that “our memory—augmented by feedback from the app, website, or appliance—allows us to keep track of our goal and what we have already done.” (Johnson, 2020). This shows how feedback can even be useful for memory as this is a sense of engagement as well to promote reassurance and being on track. </p>
            <h3>Cognitive Load and Bad Designs</h3>
            <p>Cognitive load is very closely tied to how well designed a digital system is with the worse designs causing more loads than better designs. The concept of cognitive load is just the amount of effort your brain needs to do for specific tasks from understanding visual hierarchies, understanding feedback, and learning or remembering steps. According to Userbit (2025), there are three distinct types of cognitive loads from intrinsic, extraneous, and germane loads. Intrinsic load is the inherent difficulty of the task, extraneous load is controlled by designers because this is the load from poor design itself from overloaded information, clutter, or poor navigation systems, and finally germane is the process of actively trying to understand the material, which is apparently the one most designers want their users to experience. Any of these can be the underlining issue in big cognitive loads and understanding them as the designers is extremely important.  </p>
            <img src="images/yale.png" alt="Yale School of Art Website Homepage" width="720" height="405">
            <p>An example of poor design would be the well-known Yale School of Art website. For being a part of the top universities in the country, the art school website is fully cluttered, images, bad alignment, and no color unity. This makes it very distracting to navigate and is the opposite of Tesler’s Law. Tesler’s Law purpose is to “reduce complexity for the people who use the products and services we help to build, yet there is some inherent complexity in every process.” (Yablonski, 2024). As you can see this website is the opposite of Tesler’s Law as understanding this homepage used every load in my opinion because it took a while to understand the purpose of the website and the content within it, which made the content appear more difficult than it should be for a homepage, and because it was so cluttered I lost motivation to understand it which caused more loads to have myself understand it even a little bit. This applies to any law mentioned in this blog or the previous one that each one is so crucial for designers to understand and shape around for the users benefit. Even things like visual appeal can help hide bad design because the appearance of interfaces can still feel quite intuitive and inviting to use.  </p>
            <p>Another bad feature in general is the act of forcing recalling on users instead of having recognition be the main source of remembering information. In Designing with the Mind in Mind it states that, “See and choose—or hear and choose—is easier than recall and type. Show or tell users their options and let them choose rather than force them to recall the options and tell the computer what they want.” (Johnson, 2020). Now this is to never say recalling is not an option to use in certain cases, but usability is all about making things easier for users in their goals recalling is difficult to effectively use besides certain cases, whereas recognition is easier to implement as our brains are recognition engines. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>These are the reasons usability should never be an afterthought for designers, but the most important focus. This is because people are not perfect have clear cognitive limitations. The systems should be able to stimulate the memory, their habits, and models without overloading them. They need to pander to the users in all aspects from ease of use to even feedback to confirm and lead them in the right direction. Overall, design is extremely complex and difficult to fully grasp, especially when attempting to be creative with interface designs, but the key factor to any digital system is to be usable for users. </p>

            </header>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>User interface designs and usability may not seem extremely important or noticeable at first, but they are both extremely interconnected with each other. This is interface logic coming into play which widely shapes visuals and influences user behavior from the success rate of users completing tasks, the rate of users abandoning those tasks, and even the enjoyability of the interface. Thoughtful design choices make a dramatic difference in how they hinder or guide you along the system in whatever task you have. In this blog, we will explore how interface layout and control design impact user behavior, talking about new key UX laws, and even talking about personal interface experience and why the experience went a certain way.  </p>
            <h3>Layout and Control Design</h3>
            <p>Interface layout is extremely important because users do like visually appealing designs, those designs also heavily shape the user's behavior in how they interact with the system. Having key visual differences from headings, buttons, or actions should be distinct to pinpoint the important pieces to the interface while the less important can blend into the backgrounds. When proper interface design is done with the controls being placed logically throughout the screen, also known as control design, we can prevent users from being confused and guide their experience. This is because people read and recognize objects in predictable ways from familiarity and obvious positions users gravitate towards on screen. Efficiency is another reason control design is important because having buttons, sliders, or other interactable objects to control information not placed or look appealing can turn users away from the interface. An example would be that most buttons have a link embedded into them and a visual with round edges can entice the user to click on it when they need to. A regular link to redirect the user does not have the same appeal and even improperly placed controls can cause cognitive dissonance which creates more mental loads, the opposite philosophy behind clever design.  </p>
            <h3>Postel Law</h3>
            <p>This psychological understanding of interface logic becomes more apparent when you look at the applicable UX laws which are Postel Law, Aesthetic-Usability effect, and the Von Restoriff Effect and how they relate to many of the points made. Starting with the Postel Law, this law is all about being flexible and tolerant in how the design is structured and perceived. This is important to know and remember because people are not perfect because “we are sometimes inconsistent, frequently distracted, occasionally error-prone, and usually driven by emotion.” (Yablonski, 2024). We need to always keep this in mind for design as the goal is to be friendly to users and that includes the input we receive from the designers and being able to translate that input into something more machine friendly is a sign of good designers. An example of this law in action would be a website where you need to input your phone number. In a phone number you have dashes placed throughout it, but having the user input the dashes themselves and not accepting any information without those dashes can cause frustration with users and extend the amount of time needed to complete that task. Planning against situations like this is extremely important for the user's experience. </p>
            <h3>Aesthetic-Usability Effect</h3>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/cleansite.png" alt="Pleasing Website" width="720" height="405">
               <figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@teamnocoloco">Team Nocoloco</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-website-page-with-a-star-theme-Zb-ci9sPSyg">Unsplash</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>While Postel law talks about the flexibility aspect in design let us now talk about the Aesthetic-Usability Effect, which as the name suggests is about the looks. This effect is extremely powerful because “Aesthetic Usability Effect occurs when people perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more functional and easier to use, regardless of actual usability. These bias leads users to associate beauty with quality and effectiveness, often preferring visually attractive products over more practical but less appealing alternatives.” (Patov, 2024). I can say this applies to myself as well because I tend to forgive a website often when the appearance and overall “feel” of the website was more enjoyable than others. Even appealing designs can have intentional ways to guide users with their clean layouts, coherent color choices and even shadows or other effects to bring life into the interface for ease of use. Using aesthetics is an incredibly strong strategy for user's experiences and even their trust in the interface. </p>
            <h3>Von Restoriff Effect</h3>
            <p>Going by the name Isolation Effect, the Von Restoriff Effect the psychological principle that items that stand out are more easily remembered by users. A straightforward way to remember this is you are looking at a black and white image and something with vibrant color is in the image somewhere. </p>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/rose.png" alt="Black and White background with colored Rose" width="400" height="650">
               <figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alaaiqj">Ala Mohammed</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-white-rose-with-black-leaves-on-a-dark-background-t0a3sgSp4Sg">Unsplash</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You are more likely to remember the thing with color because it stands out from everything else. According to Mod (2024) in Von Restorff Effect: UX Law of Distinctiveness, this is a survival mechanism where we would notice and remember deviations and alert our brains. This is crucial in alerting users about important things like buttons, more specifically call-to-action (CTA) buttons. An example of this would be a website like Amazon and how their sign in button is yellow they do not use almost anywhere else. The important detail is almost nowhere else because this means they are smart in not overusing this effect and are sparingly using it for users to remember these key CTA which some are the add to cart, their prime service, or a couple of others. </p>
            <h3>Interface Experiences</h3>
            <p>A positive experience would be the Spotify mobile app. Spotify uses the UX Laws extremely well because of the flexibility their search engine had on myself on if I made a typo, the interface would auto correct or offer suggestions to what I was looking for. The interface's aesthetics are appealing because of its modern appearance, color choices, and contrasting them with images for album covers. Finally, the isolation of key buttons or features like the play or pause button being the biggest button in comparison to everything else and in the middle makes it easy to remember where it is. These are the reasons why I would talk about this experience compared to other music centric apps because it brought an emotional response to my preference and “If there is no difference in your emotional response to two alternatives, you will have difficulty choosing between them. Emotional response is essential to decision-making.” (Johnson, 2020). This is why I personally feel that Spotify has brought a positive experience as an interface because it has used the UX Laws and that they used interface logic to shape this positive experience. </p>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/spotify.png" alt="Spotify APP UI" width="480" height="270">
               <figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rmrdnl">Daniel Romero</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-holding-up-a-tablet-with-a-picture-on-it-JkpvkxUF22g">Unsplash</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>A negative experience would be something that misses any of the UX laws a foundation. Examples would be where everything starts to blend in from backgrounds to key buttons being too similar in color or contrasting colors are used too often. The layout is very one note which lowers the emotional decision making in using this interface, and a more rigid system overall without flexibility for users. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, the logic interfaces have in the core of their design shape the user's actions, the way they are meant to perceive and remember information, and the emotions they can relate to the interface. UX Laws from being flexible in feedback and accommodating to users, the aesthetics being a strong asset to any interface, and highlighting key points or important parts in the system with unique isolations to them make the experience a fluid motion overall. The goal of design is to adapt and be widely accessible to users, not the other way around. </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Interface interactions are not just about functionality; they are about timing, motion, and error prevention. These range from the amount of delay users feel, any animations, and every confirmation message having a mutual conversation with the user to lead them to a meaningful and ethical experience. Giving the sense of control to users without huge workloads is an amazing design. Bad design in these aspects will bring negative emotions for users and even possibly alienate them away from the interface. This blog post will explore the patterns of timing, motion, and error prevention with how they shape the experience of the interface overall. We will also go over multiple UX laws that closely relate to this topic and the importance of everything overall. </p>

            </div>
            <h3>Timing and Feedback</h3>
            <p>Responsiveness is closely tied to emotional experience when dealing with digital systems. The amount of time needed to give feedback is under four hundred milliseconds. This is the expectation in digital interfaces which directly align with the Doherty Threshold. This fast feedback is important because “When users receive immediate feedback in response to their actions, they feel acknowledged, which, in turn, increases engagement.” (Mod, 2024). This increase in engagement is important because this will lower the overall number of users leaving tasks unfinished or even dropping the task all together. Our brains are sensitive to lengthy delays and can cause a drop in motivation and productivity which is prevented if we understand the threshold of around or less than four hundred milliseconds. A feedback animation such as a loading one can be used during this downtime to keep anxiety low.  </p>
            <h3>Motion and Flow</h3>
            <p>Motion is another important pattern that helps the users stay oriented with the tasks at hand and is also tied to the emotional response for users. The previous mention of a loading animation is a prime example of the users intuitively understanding the situation at hand, leaving them reassured and leaving less mental effort. A UX law that closely relates to the emotional response from users is the Peak-End Rule. This is based on how the brain remembers information as not one fluid recording, but in snapshots, more specifically the peak of our emotions of a specific moment and the end of the moment. So, “When designing interfaces and experiences, pay attention to the most intense points of a typical user journey (the “peaks”) and the final moments (the “end”).” (Kane, 2024). So, this places an important emphasis on optimizing the experience where there will be a peak pleasant experience with a good end instead of creating an average pleasant experience throughout the interface. Another key point from the article is that they mention that negative experiences tend to be remembered more than positive experiences so optimizing around possible negative functions within the interface is important for how people view your interface and possible not want to use your interface anymore.  </p>
            <p>Flow is an important part of motion coinciding with the Peak-End Rule as when motion is fully supporting the user, they can reach flow which is a “mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.” (Yablonski, 2024). This is difficult to achieve as finding the right spot between engaging and difficulty is important to have users reach this state especially with users varying skill levels. This is important to keep in mind as a designer though because a flow state allows people to be up to five times more productive than normal. </p>
            <h3>Error Prevention</h3>
            <p>Error prevention is not just about how smooth and usable the interface is, it is about protecting users from negative experiences from data loss, any unexpected harmful effects to users, and most importantly not arising negative emotions from users. Designing with clear guidance in mind or offering ways to recover from mistakes is a showing of proper user design. The question would be on how to prevent mistakes in the first place which it was mentioned that “The main way to help people avoid making mistakes—errors of intention—is to provide accurate information in a form they can easily understand.” (Johnson, 2020). Clear information is always important while not having the user remember too much information is crucial to keeping up with Miller’s Law where people have a set number of things they are to keep in their working memory. Further into the chapter a simple solution to prevent mistakes from disabling the submit button until all actions are properly filled in or to recovery from a mistake is to add a simple undo button and confirming with the user any substantial changes that can affect the system. These solutions around mistakes are important to incorporate as to prevent the user from feeling like the mistake completely lies on themselves instead even when the fault can come from the system itself especially when the undo feature is a common interface function and not having it would alleviate from Jakob’s Law. Overall, it is important to keep error prevention in mind as it closely follows many UX laws which focuses on lowering mental strain and usability. </p>
            <h3>Persuasive Design and Ethics</h3>
            <p>Persuasion techniques are an effective way to improve engagement from users, but there are questions about ethics in using these techniques and how important it is. There are around seven principles of persuasion according to Exploring the ethics of persuasive design: scarcity, authority, reciprocity, consistency, liking, social proof, and unity. (Philips). Some of these principles like scarcity can become quite scary as it makes people feel like they need the product before it disappears, but this also can become a good source of information for people to decide if they are in current need of the product or they can delay their purchase to when they are back in stock. Another positive example would be the use of consistency. Duolingo uses this well in the fact that there are streaks and rewards associated with constant use of their service, which is good as a language learning service. There are multiple ways to interpret these techniques being used, and transparency is a safe way to build trust between the user and the designers. There are also many other ethical guidelines to help build trust like privacy, outlining the guidelines and laws, constantly staying educated from the designer and users' sides. At the end of the day, the most important things are that “It’s time that designers confront this tension and accept that it’s our responsibility to create products and experiences that support and align with the goals and well-being of users.” (Yablonski, 2024). The designers at the end of the day understand that users are suspected of exploitation and create a professionally designed system with ethics in mind carefully tailoring for the users.  </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Design is about communication between designers and their users. Timing, motion, and error prevention are all important for designers to understand and keep a look out constantly. They all are a crucial part of the user experience and how they view our interface. Designers need to keep a strong ethical responsibility for the emotional and psychological side of users because of the trust users need to have to use their interface. This is crucial; any trust lost is incredibly hard to get back after the situation passes. Overall, when interaction design is done properly, it defines the users experience from not just usability, but also their emotional attachment to your interface. </p>
