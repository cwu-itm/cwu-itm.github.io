            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p> In this day and age, where complexity is the rule rather than the exception, the ability to understand and manage complex systems is not just important; it is essential with the digital world becoming more and more critical. Whether designing a rocket ship, managing a global supply chain, or even working to address the mass issues of climate change, traditional linear thinking and isolated problem-solving often fall short. This is where systems thinking and model-based systems engineering (MBSE) come into play. These approaches offer a transformative way to view, analyze, and solve problems—helping to fix wrong information, adaptability, and clarity. While systems thinking reshapes our perception of challenges, model-based system engineering gives us the tools to bring well-informed solutions to life. Together, they form a powerful group for building better systems in an increasingly complex world. </p>
            <h3> Systems Thinking </h3>
            <p>At its core, systems thinking is the ability to see the whole rather than just the parts. Unlike traditional thinking, which tends to isolate variables and sometimes miss the entire picture, systems thinking encourages a holistic view. It challenges everyone to look beyond the surface, capture patterns, identify root causes of different things, and understand the dynamic interplay among system components. Imagine trying to reduce traffic in a congested city. A traditional approach might focus on widening roads. As a systems thinker, you would consider a wider lens the city’s public transportation system, population growth, and urban destination. We understand that changing one part of the system will inevitably affect others. Sometimes, the solution to traffic congestion isn't more roads but better trains, remote work incentives, or even rethinking how the city is built. More and more people these days are turning to different means of transportation instead of owning a car. Alot of the new generation has opted out of having a driver's license and has turned to using bikes, buses, or just walking to where they are trying to go. Even cities have attempted to reduce the amount of traffic by making people pay to drive through the city. This year, even New York passed a law where “Vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone, local streets and avenues in Manhattan south of and including 60 Street, are being charged a toll. It is called the Congestion Pricing Program. This passed March 5th of 2025 in hopes of reducing the traffic. Many people are unhappy with this law, especiallyUberr drivers who use there cars as a means of income, but overall, this has been a very effective program and has reduced some of the awful city traffic. This is a great example of what system thinking is all about and why it's so important in this day and age. Systems thinking provides the mindset needed to navigate todays digital challenges effectively while model-based systems engineering (MBSE) gives us the tools to use it effectively. “MBSE in a digital-modeling environment provides advantages that document-based systems engineering cannot provide (Shevchenko 2020)”. Her article explains the full extent of what model-based systems engineering is used for and how it is used. MBSE represents a shift away from traditional, document-heavy methods toward dynamic, digital modeling that grows alongside the system it represents. Instead of juggling fragmented requirements, architectural plans, and behavioral diagrams across spreadsheets and static documents, MBSE unifies these elements into a centralized, interactive model. This real-time, shared reference point acts as the single source of truth for the entire project team. </p>
            <h3> Strengths and weaknesses of systems thinking</h3>
            <p>MBSE's biggest strengths are better communication with collaborators and high error detection. The best thing about MBSE is the consistency in the information. “The challenge of complexity has existed since the inception of Systems Engineering. MBSE solves this challenge by allowing the system engineer to create a much more comprehensive vision of the system. This easy-to-comprehend model gives room for much better consistency in information (Eclipse 2022). This quote highlights a central advantage of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in addressing the long-standing challenge of complexity in systems engineering. Engineers have always struggled to handle multiple information components. They often use documents that make it difficult to maintain an understanding of the stuff they are working on. MBSE offers a solution by allowing engineers to build visual models that represent the system entirely instead of multiple disconnected parts. These models are not only easier to comprehend but also improve information consistency, reducing the risk of miscommunication or errors that can occur when different teams rely on separate documents. By providing a clear and unified vision, MBSE helps engineers align on system goals, spot conflicts early, and ensure that all aspects of the design work together perfectly. In this way, MBSE turns complexity into something that can be seen, understood, and managed well making it easier on the engineers. Some of the disadvantages of MBSE are usability issues and the cost to implement. The biggest challenge associated with model-based systems engineering is the cost to apply it. Unlike traditional document-based systems, which allows more flexibility and use of multiple tools, MBSE typically requires brands to use software that must be maintained, updated, and operated by IT people since it is pretty complex. This requires the company also to have to pay for staff and potentially training on how to use the software. This can be an issue for smaller companies. As a result, organizations may struggle to justify the transition if their current methods are working well enough for them, even if MBSE offers long-term benefits like better integration and system visibility.</p>
            <h3> Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, the complexity of systems from urban infrastructure to global supply chains, demands a smarter, more adaptable approach to problem-solving. Systems thinking and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) answers that need. Systems thinking helps equips us with the mindset to see the bigger picture and understand how individual components interact within the system's whole. MBSE, on the other hand, provides the technical tools to bring those insights to life through with visual models that help foster collaboration, consistency, and clarity across disciplines, making mistakes harder to make. As demonstrated by real-world examples like New York City’s Congestion Pricing Program, systems thinking has practical value in creating sustainable, long-term solutions. It pushes us to look beyond surface-level fixes and address the root causes of complex challenges because not everything is how it seems. Similarly, MBSE empowers engineers to detect design flaws early, work across departments more efficiently, and maintain a consistent vision throughout a system’s cycle. Of course, these approaches are not without challenges. MBSE, in particular, can be costly to implement and requires dedicated infrastructure and expertise. But the long-term benefits reduced risk, enhanced communication, and higher quality systems often outweigh the initial investment, especially in industries where safety, precision, and reliability are non-negotiable thus is why its much more common to see today. Together, systems thinking and MBSE represent a shift in engineering and design. They signal a move away from reactive methods toward integrated, proactive ones. As technology continues to evolve, these approaches will only grow in importance, helping us build not just better systems but create more innovative, more responsible, and more resilient ones. </p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>In today’s fast-paced digital world, the development of reliable and sustainable systems is more needed than ever. An essential framework that supports this process is the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a structured approach used to guide the planning and creation of digital systems. As well as keeping them well-maintained. By breaking down complex projects into clearly defined stages, the SDLC makes sure that development is both efficient and aligned with the needs of the user. Within this framework, several life cycle models have come into view,  each of the models offering distinct benefits and challenges. Understanding their characteristics helps organizations choose the right approach for their needs, timelines, and resources. Moreover, thinking in terms of a system's life cycle fosters a long-term perspective that goes beyond initial development. It encourages strategies for sustainability and adaptability, ensuring digital systems continue to deliver value in our ever-changing technological landscape.</p>
      <h3>The systems development lifecycle</h3>
      <p>Understanding System Interfaces is one of the most important aspects of developing any System, as they form the backbone of the System Model. The fundamental building blocks of any System are the System Elements that make up the hierarchy and the Interfaces between these various System Elements. Remember, the entire approach to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is based on having a consistent and coherent Ontology in place. Therefore, before the different levels of abstraction can be discussed in detail, it is important to understand how all of the Views that comprise the Model can be demonstrated to be consistent with the underlying MBSE Ontology” (Holt, 2023). 
         The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a comprehensive and methodical framework used to guide the planning and development of information systems. We also use SDLC to maintain those exact systems. Complex projects particularly benefit from the structure and clarity provided by the Systems Development Life Cycle. These types of projects often involve multiple stakeholders. They intricate technical challenges that can slow down progress, or worse, lead to costly mistakes if not appropriately managed. The SDLC offers a step-by-step methodology that helps break down the complexity into manageable phases, allowing project managers to plan precisely how they need, allocate resources wisely, and maintain strong communication among teams. By following this structured approach, potential issues such as unclear requirements or integration issues can be anticipated and addressed as early in the process as possible. This reduces the risk of failure and ensures that each stage of development builds correctly on the previous one. In doing so, the SDLC not only minimizes mistakes but also creates a more efficient workflow that keeps complex projects on track and helps them be successful. It serves as a roadmap for developers, project managers, and even stakeholders, ensuring that each phase of system development is carefully considered and executed. The System Development Life Cycle typically consists of several core stages: Project planning is the first stage, “The first stage of SDLC is all about “What do we want?” Project planning is a vital role in the software delivery lifecycle since this is the part where the team estimates the cost and defines the requirements of the new software” (Thampy, 2019). The next stage is gathering and analyzing the system's requirements; here, the team gathers as much information as possible to create the best work for their client. Stage three is the design stage. “The program developer scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end-user” (Thampy, 2019). Next is the coding stage, where they translate their design into computer code.
         The team is typically divided and assigned to different modules to expedite the process. In the end, they start putting the entire system together using the programming they choose. Stage 5, once that said software is in the system, they put it to the test. Making sure the system is clear of any bugs or issues that will be problems down the road. Deployment is the second-to-last stage of the SDLC. At this stage, programmers release the product to the customer. The user is then trained on how to operate the software efficiently. The final stage is called maintenance, it is pretty straightforward, it is where the product is taken care of to ensure the best use possible. Each of these stages plays a crucial role in the successful development of a system, enabling teams to stay on track, manage risks effectively, and meet the customer expectations. Notably, the SDLC provides a structured approach to problem-solving and allows for accountability at each phase, ensuring that systems are built with a clear understanding of requirements, resources, and potential challenges that may arise. Depending on the chosen life cycle model, teams may move through these stages in different ways. Still, the SDLC as a whole emphasizes the importance of structure and, of course, planning in system development. By following a defined life cycle, organizations can minimize costly errors, improve collaboration, and deliver systems that are more robust and sustainable. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, the SDLC remains a crucial tool for ensuring that digital systems are not only well-built but also adaptable for any future needs.

         <h3>Advantages and potential drawbacks of linear, iterative, and incremental Life Cycle Models</h3>
         </p>The linear, iterative, and incremental life cycle models each offer unique advantages and, unfortunately, some disadvantages, making them suitable for different types of projects. The linear model, often referred to as the Waterfall model, is straightforward and easy to manage.
            Making it ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected change. An advantage of the waterfall model is how easy it is to establish a timeline, according to this article:  “A predefined schedule with deadlines for each development stage allows for a structured progression, resembling a car moving through a car wash, potentially leading to on-time delivery” (Ghosh, 2024). Another advantage is how organized the process is; each face is completed one at a time, which creates a well-organized workflow. There are several disadvantages to the linear model, one of which is that it is irreversible. “The strict waterfall model does not allow for revisiting completed stages. Once a stage is finished, rectifying any identified problems becomes impractical” (Ghosh, 2024).  The iterative model allows for repeated cycles of development, enabling early feedback and continuous refinement. One of the most significant advantages of the model is continuous refinement; issues are easy to fix, and you can go back and remove anything that may cause or is causing issues. A disadvantage of this model is that each face is rigid, and this can lead to a less flexible development process overall. 
            The incremental model offers a balanced approach by delivering the system in smaller, functional pieces, allowing users to benefit from early features while the whole system is still under development. It improves testing and reduces initial delivery time; however, integrating separate components later can become extremely difficult, especially if earlier increments were not planned with future additions in mind. Overall, selecting the right model depends on the project’s complexity, clarity of requirements, and the need for adaptability throughout the development process.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, the Systems Development Life Cycle serves as a vital framework in the planning, creation, and long-term management of digital systems, especially when dealing with complex and large-scale projects. Each phase of the SDLC contributes to the development of systems that are not only functional but also adaptable and sustainable. By offering a structured approach, the SDLC minimizes confusion and improves collaboration. As discussed, different life cycle models, linear, iterative, and incremental, offer varying benefits and challenges. The linear model brings structure and simplicity but struggles with flexibility, making it better suited for projects with fixed requirements. The iterative model enables ongoing improvement and user feedback, although it may also risk inefficiency. Meanwhile, the incremental model offers quicker delivery and modular development, though later integration can present difficulties if early planning is inadequate. Regardless of the chosen model, thinking in terms of a system’s full life cycle is essential not only for designing effective systems but also for ensuring their long-term viability. In today’s fast-evolving digital world, such a perspective supports innovation, sustainability, and responsible system evolution, making the SDLC an indispensable tool for modern development teams.</p>
