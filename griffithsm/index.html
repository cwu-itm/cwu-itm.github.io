            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In this day and age, where complexity is the rule rather than the exception, the ability to understand and manage complex systems is not just important; its extremely essential, with the digital world becoming more and more critical. Whether designing a rocket ship, managing a global supply chain, or even working to address the mass issues of climate change, traditional linear thinking and isolated problem-solving often fall short. This is where systems thinking and model-based systems engineering (MBSE) come into play. These approaches offer a transformative way to view, solve problems helping to correct misinformation, and improve adaptability. While systems thinking reshapes our perception of challenges, model-based system engineering gives us the tools to bring well-informed solutions to life. Together, they form a powerful group for building better systems in an increasingly complex world.</p>
            <h3>Systems thinking:</h3>
            <p>At its core, systems thinking is the ability to see the whole rather than just the parts. Unlike traditional thinking, which tends to isolate variables and sometimes misses the entire picture, systems thinking encourages a holistic view. It challenges everyone to look beyond the surface, capture patterns, identify root causes, and understand the dynamic interplay among system components. Imagine trying to reduce traffic in a congested city. A traditional approach might focus on widening roads. As a systems thinker, you would consider a wider lens on the city’s public transportation system, population growth, and urban destination. We understand that changing one part of the system will inevitably affect others. Sometimes, the solution to traffic congestion isn't more roads but better trains, remote work incentives, or even rethinking how the city is built. More and more people these days are turning to different means of transportation instead of owning a car. A Alot of the new generation has opted out of having a driver's license and has turned to bikes, buses, or just walking to where they are going. Even cities have attempted to reduce traffic by charging people to drive through the city. This year, even New York passed a law where “Vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone, local streets and avenues in Manhattan south of and including 60 Street, are being charged a toll. It is called the Congestion Pricing Program. This passed on March 5th of 2025, in hopes of reducing the traffic. Many people are unhappy with this law, especially Uber drivers who use their cars as a means of income, but overall, this has been a very effective program and has reduced some of the awful city traffic. This is a great example of what systems thinking is all about and why it's so important in this day and age. Systems thinking provides the mindset needed to navigate today's digital challenges effectively, while model-based systems engineering (MBSE) gives us the tools to use it effectively. “MBSE in a digital-modeling environment provides advantages that document-based systems engineering cannot provide (Shevchenko 2020)”. Her article explains the full extent to which model-based systems engineering is used and how it is used. MBSE represents a shift away from traditional, document-heavy methods toward dynamic, digital modeling that grows alongside the system it represents. Instead of juggling fragmented requirements, architectural plans, and behavioral diagrams across spreadsheets and static documents, MBSE unifies these elements into a centralized, interactive model. This real-time, shared reference point acts as the single source of truth for the entire project team.
               
               

Strengths and weaknesses of systems thinking

MBSE's biggest strengths are better communication with collaborators and high error detection. The best thing about MBSE is the consistency in the information. “The challenge of complexity has existed since the inception of Systems Engineering. MBSE addresses this challenge by enabling the system engineer to create a more comprehensive vision of the system. This easy-to-understand model allows for greater consistency in information (Eclipse 2022). This quote highlights a central advantage of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in addressing the long-standing challenge of system complexity. Engineers have always struggled to handle multiple information components. They often use documents that make it difficult to maintain a clear understanding of what they are working on. MBSE offers a solution by allowing engineers to build visual models that represent the system as a whole rather than as multiple disconnected parts. These models are not only easier to comprehend but also improve information consistency, reducing the risk of miscommunication or errors that can occur when different teams rely on separate documents. By providing a clear and unified vision, MBSE helps engineers align on system goals, spot conflicts early, and ensure that all aspects of the design work together perfectly. In this way, MBSE turns complexity into something that can be seen, understood, and managed well, making it easier on the engineers. Some disadvantages of MBSE include usability issues and implementation costs. The biggest challenge associated with model-based systems engineering is the cost to apply it. Unlike traditional document-based systems, which allow more flexibility and use of multiple tools, MBSE typically requires brands to use software that must be maintained, updated, and operated by IT people since it is pretty complex. This requires the company to have to pay for staff and potentially training on how to use the software. This can be an issue for smaller companies. As a result, organizations may struggle to justify the transition if their current methods are working well enough, even if MBSE offers long-term benefits such as improved integration and system visibility. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, the complexity of systems from urban infrastructure to global supply chains demands a smarter, more adaptable approach to problem-solving. Systems thinking and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) answers that need. Systems thinking helps equip us with the mindset to see the bigger picture and understand how individual components interact within the system's whole. MBSE, on the other hand, provides the technical tools to bring those insights to life through with visual models that help foster collaboration, consistency, and clarity across disciplines, making mistakes harder to make. As demonstrated by real-world examples like New York City’s Congestion Pricing Program, systems thinking has practical value in creating sustainable, long-term solutions. It pushes us to look beyond surface-level fixes and address the root causes of complex challenges because not everything is how it seems. Similarly, MBSE empowers engineers to detect design flaws early, work across departments more efficiently, and maintain a consistent vision throughout a system’s cycle. Of course, these approaches are not without challenges. MBSE, in particular, can be costly to implement and requires dedicated infrastructure and expertise. But the long-term benefits, reduced risk, enhanced communication, and higher quality systems often outweigh the initial investment, especially in industries where safety, precision, and reliability are non-negotiable, which is why it's much more common to see today. Together, systems thinking and MBSE represent a shift in engineering and design. They signal a move away from reactive methods toward integrated, proactive ones. As technology continues to evolve, these approaches will only grow in importance, helping us build not just better systems but create more innovative, more responsible, and more resilient ones. </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>As our world becomes increasingly digital, good design is more than clean aesthetics or high-functioning interfaces. It's about creating experiences that show how humans feel, think, and react to certain things. Designing for people means putting our needs and behaviors at the forefront of every design decision. At the heart of this philosophy is human-centered design, a process that starts with understanding the people you're designing for and ends with solutions made to meet their real needs.
</p>
<h3>Human Centered Design:</h3>
    <p3>Human-centered design (HCD) is more than just a methodology; it is a mindset that prioritizes people’s needs, behaviors, and experiences throughout the design process. “Human-centered design (HCD) is a philosophy and method that places people’s experiences at the heart of service design. Unlike traditional, system-centric approaches, HCD prioritizes understanding real-world challenges and frustrations faced by users and crafting solutions that directly address them” (Digital.gov). This aims to create solutions that are not only technically functional but also perfectly aligned with how human users think, feel, and interact daily with the world around them. “Fitts’s law was established as a model for understanding human movement in the physical world before the invention of the graphical user interface, but it can also be applied to movement through a digital interface” (Yablonski 13). This approach involves engaging the user early in the design process and meeting their needs as much as possible. We also learn from their feedback and create adaptive designs based on their personal life experiences. The human-centered design process typically involves three important stages: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. The beginning face of human-centered design is Inspiration. This stage is where the research team identifies people's real-world issues, puts themselves in others' shoes, and finds the issues people need resolved. Our next stage is Ideation, where design teams identify solutions to these issues and research and test them through case studies and surveys. According to Blakely: “prototyping with real people helps team members with problem-solving, allowing them to improve techniques, learn from mistakes, and perfect solutions” (2021). The last stage of the Human-Centered Design process is implementation, where the team publishes their final work for the audience to see and interact with. Human-centered design ensures that the final product serves a real purpose and is accessible, inclusive, and usable for all who need it. For example, when designing a mobile health app for athletes, human-centered design prompts the team to consider a simple app layout and modern features and details that may be overlooked in a tech-focused development process. This modern, iterative approach ensures that solutions are not only innovative but also grounded in human realities.
</p3>
    <h3>ISO 9241-210:</h3>
    <p>While the concept of human-centered design is widely known and used, different frameworks offer more distant perspectives on how to practice it. ISO 9241-210 is an international standard for human-centered design. It provides a structured, systematic approach focused on usability. It outlines clear principles, such as understanding the context of use and involving users continuously; it also adjusts the design based on user evaluation. ISO emphasizes predictability and repeatability, which are especially valuable in industries like healthcare, aviation, and finance, where safety is a top priority. In terms of readability, since making mistakes can be critical to success, IDEO’s Field Guide to Human-Centered Design promotes a more creative process. It pushes designers to picture themselves in users' lives and observe their behaviors to develop solutions through brainstorming. IDEO’s approach is beneficial in fields that benefit from innovation, such as education and social design. An example is IDEO, which may start a new project by talking to community members and taking notes on their personal experiences. In contrast, ISO would likely start with user requirements and task analysis. Despite their differences, both frameworks share the main belief that including users leads to better outcomes. Integrating ISO’s precision with IDEO’s emotional insight can help teams create products that are not only effective but also meaningful to the people assigned to them.

    <h3>How perception and visual hierarchy affect usability</h3>
    <p3>A critical component of designing for people involves understanding how human perception and their attention influence interaction with digital products. Perception refers to how users interpret visual information, while attention refers to what they focus on and for how long. These psychological processes directly affect usability because they show how much ease a user needs to navigate and complete tasks. Designers use visual hierarchy to guide attention by controlling the size, color, contrast, and placement of elements.  An example is when a website uses bold text at the top of its page or a bright-colored box that says “click here!” When a brand uses these examples, it is trying to grab the user's attention. This naturally draws the user's eye. If all text is the same size and color, users may feel overwhelmed or disoriented, which increases cognitive load and reduces satisfaction. Accessibility also plays a role here. A designer considering users with visual impairments may include strong contrast and compatibility with screen readers. Similarly, understanding that users most likely skim over rather than read allows for scannable layouts with icons and bullet points. “Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an expectation of design conventions based on their cumulative experience from other websites” (Yablonski 9). Some brands, including Apple, use high-quality visuals, brief descriptions, and simple navigation on their websites to make the experience seamless. By aligning design with human perception and accessibility, and anticipating user needs, designers can create interfaces that feel effortless and efficient, making them enjoyable to use.
</p3>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Designing for people means recognizing that every interface, product, or service begins with a deep understanding of the people for whom it will be used. Human-centered design challenges inventors to move beyond basic aesthetics and confusing functionality, and instead to focus on empathy, real-world problems, and user behavior. “Miller was an early pioneer in recognizing that the human mind can be understood using an information-processing model and that our working memory capacity has inherent limits” (Yablonski 17).  Frameworks such as ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide offer complementary approaches, emphasizing structure and precision on the one hand, and creativity and emotional insight on the other. Together, they show us that the best designs are both usable and impactful. Additionally, when designers understand how perception and attention shape users' experiences through clarity and accessibility, they can quickly craft solutions. In a world where digital interactions are part of everyday life, designing with people in mind is no longer optional; it’s essential.
