            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p> In this day and age, where complexity is the rule rather than the exception, the ability to understand and manage complex systems is not just important; it is essential with the digital world becoming more and more critical. Whether designing a rocket ship, managing a global supply chain, or even working to address the mass issues of climate change, traditional linear thinking and isolated problem-solving often fall short. This is where systems thinking and model-based systems engineering (MBSE) come into play. These approaches offer a transformative way to view, analyze, and solve problems—helping to fix wrong information, adaptability, and clarity. While systems thinking reshapes our perception of challenges, model-based system engineering gives us the tools to bring well-informed solutions to life. Together, they form a powerful group for building better systems in an increasingly complex world. </p>
            <h3> Systems Thinking </h3>
            <p>At its core, systems thinking is the ability to see the whole rather than just the parts. Unlike traditional thinking, which tends to isolate variables and sometimes miss the entire picture, systems thinking encourages a holistic view. It challenges everyone to look beyond the surface, capture patterns, identify root causes of different things, and understand the dynamic interplay among system components. Imagine trying to reduce traffic in a congested city. A traditional approach might focus on widening roads. As a systems thinker, you would consider a wider lens the city’s public transportation system, population growth, and urban destination. We understand that changing one part of the system will inevitably affect others. Sometimes, the solution to traffic congestion isn't more roads but better trains, remote work incentives, or even rethinking how the city is built. More and more people these days are turning to different means of transportation instead of owning a car. Alot of the new generation has opted out of having a driver's license and has turned to using bikes, buses, or just walking to where they are trying to go. Even cities have attempted to reduce the amount of traffic by making people pay to drive through the city. This year, even New York passed a law where “Vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone, local streets and avenues in Manhattan south of and including 60 Street, are being charged a toll. It is called the Congestion Pricing Program. This passed March 5th of 2025 in hopes of reducing the traffic. Many people are unhappy with this law, especiallyUberr drivers who use there cars as a means of income, but overall, this has been a very effective program and has reduced some of the awful city traffic. This is a great example of what system thinking is all about and why it's so important in this day and age. Systems thinking provides the mindset needed to navigate todays digital challenges effectively while model-based systems engineering (MBSE) gives us the tools to use it effectively. “MBSE in a digital-modeling environment provides advantages that document-based systems engineering cannot provide (Shevchenko 2020)”. Her article explains the full extent of what model-based systems engineering is used for and how it is used. MBSE represents a shift away from traditional, document-heavy methods toward dynamic, digital modeling that grows alongside the system it represents. Instead of juggling fragmented requirements, architectural plans, and behavioral diagrams across spreadsheets and static documents, MBSE unifies these elements into a centralized, interactive model. This real-time, shared reference point acts as the single source of truth for the entire project team. </p>
            <h3> Strengths and weaknesses of systems thinking</h3>
            <p>MBSE's biggest strengths are better communication with collaborators and high error detection. The best thing about MBSE is the consistency in the information. “The challenge of complexity has existed since the inception of Systems Engineering. MBSE solves this challenge by allowing the system engineer to create a much more comprehensive vision of the system. This easy-to-comprehend model gives room for much better consistency in information (Eclipse 2022). This quote highlights a central advantage of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in addressing the long-standing challenge of complexity in systems engineering. Engineers have always struggled to handle multiple information components. They often use documents that make it difficult to maintain an understanding of the stuff they are working on. MBSE offers a solution by allowing engineers to build visual models that represent the system entirely instead of multiple disconnected parts. These models are not only easier to comprehend but also improve information consistency, reducing the risk of miscommunication or errors that can occur when different teams rely on separate documents. By providing a clear and unified vision, MBSE helps engineers align on system goals, spot conflicts early, and ensure that all aspects of the design work together perfectly. In this way, MBSE turns complexity into something that can be seen, understood, and managed well making it easier on the engineers. Some of the disadvantages of MBSE are usability issues and the cost to implement. The biggest challenge associated with model-based systems engineering is the cost to apply it. Unlike traditional document-based systems, which allows more flexibility and use of multiple tools, MBSE typically requires brands to use software that must be maintained, updated, and operated by IT people since it is pretty complex. This requires the company also to have to pay for staff and potentially training on how to use the software. This can be an issue for smaller companies. As a result, organizations may struggle to justify the transition if their current methods are working well enough for them, even if MBSE offers long-term benefits like better integration and system visibility.</p>
            <h3> Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, the complexity of systems from urban infrastructure to global supply chains, demands a smarter, more adaptable approach to problem-solving. Systems thinking and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) answers that need. Systems thinking helps equips us with the mindset to see the bigger picture and understand how individual components interact within the system's whole. MBSE, on the other hand, provides the technical tools to bring those insights to life through with visual models that help foster collaboration, consistency, and clarity across disciplines, making mistakes harder to make. As demonstrated by real-world examples like New York City’s Congestion Pricing Program, systems thinking has practical value in creating sustainable, long-term solutions. It pushes us to look beyond surface-level fixes and address the root causes of complex challenges because not everything is how it seems. Similarly, MBSE empowers engineers to detect design flaws early, work across departments more efficiently, and maintain a consistent vision throughout a system’s cycle. Of course, these approaches are not without challenges. MBSE, in particular, can be costly to implement and requires dedicated infrastructure and expertise. But the long-term benefits reduced risk, enhanced communication, and higher quality systems often outweigh the initial investment, especially in industries where safety, precision, and reliability are non-negotiable thus is why its much more common to see today. Together, systems thinking and MBSE represent a shift in engineering and design. They signal a move away from reactive methods toward integrated, proactive ones. As technology continues to evolve, these approaches will only grow in importance, helping us build not just better systems but create more innovative, more responsible, and more resilient ones. </p>
