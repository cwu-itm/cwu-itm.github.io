            </header>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p> In this day and age, where complexity is the rule rather than the exception, the ability to understand and manage complex systems is not just important; it is essential with the digital world becoming more and more critical. Whether designing a rocket ship, managing a global supply chain, or even working to address the mass issues of climate change, traditional linear thinking and isolated problem-solving often fall short. This is where systems thinking and model-based systems engineering (MBSE) come into play. These approaches offer a transformative way to view, analyze, and solve problems—helping to fix wrong information, adaptability, and clarity. While systems thinking reshapes our perception of challenges, model-based system engineering gives us the tools to bring well-informed solutions to life. Together, they form a powerful group for building better systems in an increasingly complex world. </p>
            <h3> Systems Thinking </h3>
            <p>At its core, systems thinking is the ability to see the whole rather than just the parts. Unlike traditional thinking, which tends to isolate variables and sometimes miss the entire picture, systems thinking encourages a holistic view. It challenges everyone to look beyond the surface, capture patterns, identify root causes of different things, and understand the dynamic interplay among system components. Imagine trying to reduce traffic in a congested city. A traditional approach might focus on widening roads. As a systems thinker, you would consider a wider lens the city’s public transportation system, population growth, and urban destination. We understand that changing one part of the system will inevitably affect others. Sometimes, the solution to traffic congestion isn't more roads but better trains, remote work incentives, or even rethinking how the city is built. More and more people these days are turning to different means of transportation instead of owning a car. Alot of the new generation has opted out of having a driver's license and has turned to using bikes, buses, or just walking to where they are trying to go. Even cities have attempted to reduce the amount of traffic by making people pay to drive through the city. This year, even New York passed a law where “Vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone, local streets and avenues in Manhattan south of and including 60 Street, are being charged a toll. It is called the Congestion Pricing Program. This passed March 5th of 2025 in hopes of reducing the traffic. Many people are unhappy with this law, especiallyUberr drivers who use there cars as a means of income, but overall, this has been a very effective program and has reduced some of the awful city traffic. This is a great example of what system thinking is all about and why it's so important in this day and age. Systems thinking provides the mindset needed to navigate todays digital challenges effectively while model-based systems engineering (MBSE) gives us the tools to use it effectively. “MBSE in a digital-modeling environment provides advantages that document-based systems engineering cannot provide (Shevchenko 2020)”. Her article explains the full extent of what model-based systems engineering is used for and how it is used. MBSE represents a shift away from traditional, document-heavy methods toward dynamic, digital modeling that grows alongside the system it represents. Instead of juggling fragmented requirements, architectural plans, and behavioral diagrams across spreadsheets and static documents, MBSE unifies these elements into a centralized, interactive model. This real-time, shared reference point acts as the single source of truth for the entire project team. </p>
            <h3> Strengths and weaknesses of systems thinking</h3>
            <p>MBSE's biggest strengths are better communication with collaborators and high error detection. The best thing about MBSE is the consistency in the information. “The challenge of complexity has existed since the inception of Systems Engineering. MBSE solves this challenge by allowing the system engineer to create a much more comprehensive vision of the system. This easy-to-comprehend model gives room for much better consistency in information (Eclipse 2022). This quote highlights a central advantage of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in addressing the long-standing challenge of complexity in systems engineering. Engineers have always struggled to handle multiple information components. They often use documents that make it difficult to maintain an understanding of the stuff they are working on. MBSE offers a solution by allowing engineers to build visual models that represent the system entirely instead of multiple disconnected parts. These models are not only easier to comprehend but also improve information consistency, reducing the risk of miscommunication or errors that can occur when different teams rely on separate documents. By providing a clear and unified vision, MBSE helps engineers align on system goals, spot conflicts early, and ensure that all aspects of the design work together perfectly. In this way, MBSE turns complexity into something that can be seen, understood, and managed well making it easier on the engineers. Some of the disadvantages of MBSE are usability issues and the cost to implement. The biggest challenge associated with model-based systems engineering is the cost to apply it. Unlike traditional document-based systems, which allows more flexibility and use of multiple tools, MBSE typically requires brands to use software that must be maintained, updated, and operated by IT people since it is pretty complex. This requires the company also to have to pay for staff and potentially training on how to use the software. This can be an issue for smaller companies. As a result, organizations may struggle to justify the transition if their current methods are working well enough for them, even if MBSE offers long-term benefits like better integration and system visibility.</p>
            <h3> Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, the complexity of systems from urban infrastructure to global supply chains, demands a smarter, more adaptable approach to problem-solving. Systems thinking and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) answers that need. Systems thinking helps equips us with the mindset to see the bigger picture and understand how individual components interact within the system's whole. MBSE, on the other hand, provides the technical tools to bring those insights to life through with visual models that help foster collaboration, consistency, and clarity across disciplines, making mistakes harder to make. As demonstrated by real-world examples like New York City’s Congestion Pricing Program, systems thinking has practical value in creating sustainable, long-term solutions. It pushes us to look beyond surface-level fixes and address the root causes of complex challenges because not everything is how it seems. Similarly, MBSE empowers engineers to detect design flaws early, work across departments more efficiently, and maintain a consistent vision throughout a system’s cycle. Of course, these approaches are not without challenges. MBSE, in particular, can be costly to implement and requires dedicated infrastructure and expertise. But the long-term benefits reduced risk, enhanced communication, and higher quality systems often outweigh the initial investment, especially in industries where safety, precision, and reliability are non-negotiable thus is why its much more common to see today. Together, systems thinking and MBSE represent a shift in engineering and design. They signal a move away from reactive methods toward integrated, proactive ones. As technology continues to evolve, these approaches will only grow in importance, helping us build not just better systems but create more innovative, more responsible, and more resilient ones. </p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>In today’s fast-paced digital world, the development of reliable and sustainable systems is more needed than ever. An essential framework that supports this process is the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a structured approach used to guide the planning and creation of digital systems. As well as keeping them well-maintained. By breaking down complex projects into clearly defined stages, the SDLC makes sure that development is both efficient and aligned with the needs of the user. Within this framework, several life cycle models have come into view,  each of the models offering distinct benefits and challenges. Understanding their characteristics helps organizations choose the right approach for their needs, timelines, and resources. Moreover, thinking in terms of a system's life cycle fosters a long-term perspective that goes beyond initial development. It encourages strategies for sustainability and adaptability, ensuring digital systems continue to deliver value in our ever-changing technological landscape.</p>
      <h3>The systems development lifecycle</h3>
      <p>Understanding System Interfaces is one of the most important aspects of developing any System, as they form the backbone of the System Model. The fundamental building blocks of any System are the System Elements that make up the hierarchy and the Interfaces between these various System Elements. Remember, the entire approach to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is based on having a consistent and coherent Ontology in place. Therefore, before the different levels of abstraction can be discussed in detail, it is important to understand how all of the Views that comprise the Model can be demonstrated to be consistent with the underlying MBSE Ontology” (Holt, 2023). 
         The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a comprehensive and methodical framework used to guide the planning and development of information systems. We also use SDLC to maintain those exact systems. Complex projects particularly benefit from the structure and clarity provided by the Systems Development Life Cycle. These types of projects often involve multiple stakeholders. They intricate technical challenges that can slow down progress, or worse, lead to costly mistakes if not appropriately managed. The SDLC offers a step-by-step methodology that helps break down the complexity into manageable phases, allowing project managers to plan precisely how they need, allocate resources wisely, and maintain strong communication among teams. By following this structured approach, potential issues such as unclear requirements or integration issues can be anticipated and addressed as early in the process as possible. This reduces the risk of failure and ensures that each stage of development builds correctly on the previous one. In doing so, the SDLC not only minimizes mistakes but also creates a more efficient workflow that keeps complex projects on track and helps them be successful. It serves as a roadmap for developers, project managers, and even stakeholders, ensuring that each phase of system development is carefully considered and executed. The System Development Life Cycle typically consists of several core stages: Project planning is the first stage, “The first stage of SDLC is all about “What do we want?” Project planning is a vital role in the software delivery lifecycle since this is the part where the team estimates the cost and defines the requirements of the new software” (Thampy, 2019). The next stage is gathering and analyzing the system's requirements; here, the team gathers as much information as possible to create the best work for their client. Stage three is the design stage. “The program developer scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end-user” (Thampy, 2019). Next is the coding stage, where they translate their design into computer code.
         The team is typically divided and assigned to different modules to expedite the process. In the end, they start putting the entire system together using the programming they choose. Stage 5, once that said software is in the system, they put it to the test. Making sure the system is clear of any bugs or issues that will be problems down the road. Deployment is the second-to-last stage of the SDLC. At this stage, programmers release the product to the customer. The user is then trained on how to operate the software efficiently. The final stage is called maintenance, it is pretty straightforward, it is where the product is taken care of to ensure the best use possible. Each of these stages plays a crucial role in the successful development of a system, enabling teams to stay on track, manage risks effectively, and meet the customer expectations. Notably, the SDLC provides a structured approach to problem-solving and allows for accountability at each phase, ensuring that systems are built with a clear understanding of requirements, resources, and potential challenges that may arise. Depending on the chosen life cycle model, teams may move through these stages in different ways. Still, the SDLC as a whole emphasizes the importance of structure and, of course, planning in system development. By following a defined life cycle, organizations can minimize costly errors, improve collaboration, and deliver systems that are more robust and sustainable. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, the SDLC remains a crucial tool for ensuring that digital systems are not only well-built but also adaptable for any future needs.

         <h3>Advantages and potential drawbacks of linear, iterative, and incremental Life Cycle Models</h3>
         </p>The linear, iterative, and incremental life cycle models each offer unique advantages and, unfortunately, some disadvantages, making them suitable for different types of projects. The linear model, often referred to as the Waterfall model, is straightforward and easy to manage.
            Making it ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected change. An advantage of the waterfall model is how easy it is to establish a timeline, according to this article:  “A predefined schedule with deadlines for each development stage allows for a structured progression, resembling a car moving through a car wash, potentially leading to on-time delivery” (Ghosh, 2024). Another advantage is how organized the process is; each face is completed one at a time, which creates a well-organized workflow. There are several disadvantages to the linear model, one of which is that it is irreversible. “The strict waterfall model does not allow for revisiting completed stages. Once a stage is finished, rectifying any identified problems becomes impractical” (Ghosh, 2024).  The iterative model allows for repeated cycles of development, enabling early feedback and continuous refinement. One of the most significant advantages of the model is continuous refinement; issues are easy to fix, and you can go back and remove anything that may cause or is causing issues. A disadvantage of this model is that each face is rigid, and this can lead to a less flexible development process overall. 
            The incremental model offers a balanced approach by delivering the system in smaller, functional pieces, allowing users to benefit from early features while the whole system is still under development. It improves testing and reduces initial delivery time; however, integrating separate components later can become extremely difficult, especially if earlier increments were not planned with future additions in mind. Overall, selecting the right model depends on the project’s complexity, clarity of requirements, and the need for adaptability throughout the development process.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, the Systems Development Life Cycle serves as a vital framework in the planning, creation, and long-term management of digital systems, especially when dealing with complex and large-scale projects. Each phase of the SDLC contributes to the development of systems that are not only functional but also adaptable and sustainable. By offering a structured approach, the SDLC minimizes confusion and improves collaboration. As discussed, different life cycle models, linear, iterative, and incremental, offer varying benefits and challenges. The linear model brings structure and simplicity but struggles with flexibility, making it better suited for projects with fixed requirements. The iterative model enables ongoing improvement and user feedback, although it may also risk inefficiency. Meanwhile, the incremental model offers quicker delivery and modular development, though later integration can present difficulties if early planning is inadequate. Regardless of the chosen model, thinking in terms of a system’s full life cycle is essential not only for designing effective systems but also for ensuring their long-term viability. In today’s fast-evolving digital world, such a perspective supports innovation, sustainability, and responsible system evolution, making the SDLC an indispensable tool for modern development teams.</p>

<h2>Module 2.1 Blog projects</h2>
         </header>
<h3>Introduction</h3>      
<p>With our world becoming increasingly digital, good design is much more than clean aesthetics or high-functioning interfaces. It's about creating experiences that show how humans feel, think, and react to certain things. Designing for people means putting our needs and behaviors at the forefront of every design decision. At the heart of this philosophy is human-centered design, a process that starts with understanding the people you're designing for and ends with solutions made to meet their real needs.</p>   
<h3>Human Centered Design</h3>
<p>Human-centered design (HCD) is more than just a methodology; it is a mindset that prioritizes people’s needs, behaviors, and experiences throughout the design process. “Human-centered design (HCD) is a philosophy and method that places people’s experiences at the heart of service design. Unlike traditional, system-centric approaches, HCD prioritizes understanding real-world challenges and frustrations faced by users and crafting solutions that directly address them” (Digital.gov). This aims to create solutions that are not only technically functional but also perfectly aligned with how human users think, feel, and interact daily with the world around them. “Fitts’s law was established as a model for understanding human movement in the physical world before the invention of the graphical user interface, but it can also be applied to movement through a digital interface” (Yablonski 13). This approach includes engaging with the user early on in the design process and meeting the user's needs as much as possible. We also learn from their feedback and create adaptive designs based on their personal life experiences. The human-centered design process typically involves three important stages: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. The beginning face of human-centered design is Inspiration; This stage is where the team of researchers identifies people's real-world issues, they put themselves in other people's shoes, and find issues that people need resolved. Our next stage is Ideation, where design teams find solutions for these issues, and they research and test solutions by doing case studies and surveys. According to Blakely: “prototyping with real people helps team members with problem-solving, allowing them to improve techniques, learn from mistakes, and perfect solutions” (2021). The last stage of the Human Centered design process is implementation, which is where the team publishes their final work for the audience to see and interact with. Human centered design ensures that the final product serves a real purpose and is accessible, inclusive, and usable to all who need it. An example is when designing a mobile health app for athletic people, human-centered design prompts the team to consider simple app layout, and modern features and details that may be overlooked in a tech-focused development process. This modern and iterative approach makes sure that solutions are not only innovative but also grounded in human realities.</p>
<h3>ISO 9241-210</h3>
<p>While the concept of human-centered design is widely known and used, different frameworks offer more distant perspectives on how to practice it. ISO 9241-210 is an international standard for human-centered design. It provides a structured, systematic approach that focuses on its usability. It outlines clear principles such as understanding the context of use and involving users continuously; it also corrects the design based on the user's evaluation. ISO emphasizes predictability and repeatability, which is especially valuable in industries like healthcare, aviation, and finance, where safety is a huge deal. As well as readability, since making mistakes could be critical to success, IDEO’s Field Guide to Human-Centered Design promotes a more creative process. It pushes designers to picture themselves in users' lives and observe their behaviors to create solutions through brainstorming ideas. IDEO’s approach is beneficial in fields that benefit from innovation, such as education and social design. An example is IDEO, which may start a new project by talking to members of the community and taking notes of their personal experiences. In contrast, ISO would likely start with user requirements and task analysis. Despite their differences, both frameworks share the main belief that including users leads to better outcomes. Integrating ISO’s precision with IDEO’s emotional intake can help teams create products that are not only effective but also meaningful to the people who are assigned to them.</p>
<h3>How perception and visual hierarchy affect usability</h3>
<p>A critical component of designing for people involves understanding how human perception and their attention influence interaction with digital products. Perception refers to how users interpret visual information, while attention refers to what they focus on and for how long. These psychological processes directly affect usability because they show how much ease a user needs to navigate and complete tasks. Designers use visual hierarchy to guide attention by controlling the size, color, contrast, and placement of elements.  AN example is when a website uses bold letters at the top of their page, or a bright colored box that says “click here!”. When a brand uses these examples, they are trying to gravate the user's attention. This naturally draws the user's eye. If all text is the same size and color, users may feel overwhelmed or disoriented, increasing cognitive load and reducing satisfaction. Accessibility also plays a role here. A designer considering users with visual impairments may include strong contrast and compatibility with screen readers. Similarly, understanding that users most likely skim over rather than read allows for scannable layouts with icons and bullet points. “Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an expectation of design conventions based on their cumulative experience from other websites” (Yablonski 9). Some brands, including Apple, use high-quality visuals, brief descriptions, and simple navigation on their website to make it seamless. By aligning design with human perception and accessibility that anticipate user needs, designers can create interfaces that feel effortless and efficient, making it enjoyable to use.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Designing for people means recognizing that every interface, product, or service begins with a deep understanding of the people it will be used for. Human-centered design challenges inventors to move beyond basic aesthetics and confusing functionality, and instead focus on empathy, real-world problems, and the user's behavior. “Miller was an early pioneer in recognizing that the human mind can be understood using an information-processing model and that our working memory capacity has inherent limits” (Yablonski 17).  Frameworks like ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide offer different but approaches that complement on another other, emphasizing structure and precision, and the other creativity and emotional insight. Together, they show us that the best designs are both usable and impactful. To add on, when the designers understand how the perception and attention shape the users experiences through clarity and accessibility, they can quickly craft solutions. In a world where digital interactions are part of everyday life, designing with people in mind is no longer optional; it’s a needed factor. </p>

<h2>Module 2.2 blog post</h2>
      </header> 
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In a world where nearly every aspect of our lives is mediated through our screens, banking, school work, shopping, and even dating are. The usability of digital systems is more critical than ever. Whether you are a student signing up for college classes or a professional working in a professional setting where you are tasked to navigate a project, the quality of your interaction can either help your work go faster or slow it down; our main question is what makes a system usable? Often, usability is misunderstood as simply looking completely fine or having no bugs. However, actual usability runs much deeper than that. It is about how a system aligns with how people think, remember, and act in daily life. It is about reducing unnecessary mental strain and making the digital experience feel natural, more so invisible. To achieve that, designers must consider how human memory, habits, and mental shortcuts shape interaction. People rely on prior experiences and internal models to make sense of new interfaces. Users feel confident and in control when digital systems align with these cognitive patterns. When become confused, and frustration can take over. Understanding how our brains handle information, what we can remember, and how we respond to feedback can drastically change how systems are built and experienced. Here I will explain the key principles that make our digital systems work. </p>
<h3>How memories and mental models influence our interactions</h3>
<p>Users who see a digital system for the first time do not start from scratch; they bring a lifetime of experiences and expectations. Mental models shape these expectations. Mental models are our internal representations of how things are supposed to work. “These mental models are constructed within a user’s mind and serve as reference points to simplify their interactions” (Nielsen, 2023). Mental models are built over time through repeated experiences of patterns and relationships. They help us predict what will happen when we take a specific action, like if we will turn a doorknob or raise our hand. In interface design, aligning with a user’s mental model is critical to creating a sense of familiarity and ease with the design. For example, most people understand the structure of a digital note-taking app based on their experience with taking physical calendars. They expect days to run from left to right, with weeks organized into rows and maybe other activities shown as different colored blocks of time. Whenana app changes this sort of layout, maybe by not showing the times of their activities, it messes up what the user expects to see, and now they are stuck spending extra time trying to figure out how to use the different layout. This increases the cognitive friction and the added mental effort to understand the app. Memory also plays a very critical role in how we use digital systems. Especially short-term memory, which is also known as working memory. Most people can hold only 4 to 7 unrelated pieces of information in their minds at once. “This type of memory is a scratchpad for temporarily recalling a limited amount of data from the sensory register and processing it through attention and recognition” (Cascella, 2024). This can be an issue when systems require users to remember lots of detailed information for a consistent period. An example is having to type in a confirmation code or memorize multiple steps to complete a process. These demands tend to overload the user’s memory, leading to errors, which causes some frustration. I have had experience with things like this. One time, I had to remember a code that was sent to my email, and I misremembered the code, causing me to have to start over, which did in fact really irritate me. Good design reduces memory load by basing recognition rather than recalling an important usability principle. Instead of expecting users to remember, effective interfaces provide visual cues and clear pathways so users can recognize their next step with minimal effort. This is why features like autocorrect and recently viewed items on Google are so helpful. They externalize memory demands and reduce the need for users to track information mentally. Additionally, designers use techniques like progressive disclosure, showing only the most relevant information or options at any given time, to help users focus on immediate tasks without being overwhelmed by everything at once. Pairing this with visible system status, such as showing users where they are in a multi-step process, and saving their place if they need a break, will help users not become overwhelmed. To add, we have a process known as Tesler's law, the formal definition is ​​” Tesler’s Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced” (Lawsofux). A real-world example of this is Tesla and its self-driving car. Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving system is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. A few taps on the large screen engage their driving system, allowing the user to relax while the car takes them to their destination.  It may seem simple, but it is powered by neural networks, high-definition mapping, real-time sensor fusion, and continuous data learning. The driver does not need to know any of that; the complexity is handled entirely by Tesla's software and hardware.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, actual usability in digital systems goes far beyond clean visuals or no glitches. It is about aligning design with people's thinking, remembering, and behaving. By considering mental models and the limits of human memory, designers can create experiences that feel natural and intuitive rather than confusing. When systems support recognition over recall, minimize cognitive friction, and offer helpful visual cues, they reduce mental effort and increase user satisfaction. Tesler’s Law reminds us that complexity cannot be eliminated; it must be managed thoughtfully, ideally by the designers, not the users. When digital tools respect how our minds work, they become easier to use and go undetected in our daily routines. The goal of good design is to make technology feel like an extension of our thoughts, not an obstacle to them. As digital interactions continue to shape how we live and work, understanding and applying these usability principles will be more important than ever.</p>
