   <h2>About Me</h2>
  <body>
   <p3>My names Mica and what defines me is how I view things in front of me, I try to point out the good in everything while also being causios. I'm also very loyal to my friends and family. I always make to sure to defend someone close to me and always be their for them. I don't let people push me around either as I always defend myself. I have been told I'm stubborn but I don't think that is neccassarly a bad thing, because I don't go down without a fight. I also try to be kind to others and do good deeds. </p3>
