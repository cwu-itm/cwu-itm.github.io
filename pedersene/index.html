            <h3>Systems engineering is tracked as far back as the 20th century. They may be seen in the world war or MIT. As time goes on systems are becoming more complex and are growing. Systems can be described in many ways like natural, abstract, physical, human, and transcendental. But systems are not just limited to one and can be complex. Now systems also have elements they interact with and are made up of. Then we have stakeholders who are interested in the system, attributes characterize the system properties, boundaries that define the scope of the system, needs the purpose of the system, constraints limiting the realization of the system. And that is the summary of the system concepts. “Systems Engineering is a multi-disciplinary, common-sense approach that enables the realization of successful systems.”  The three main reasons systems fail are because of complexity, communication, and understanding. Basically, when people do not take the time to identify a problem and communicate it accurately.  </h3>
         </p> Systems thinking as described in the article can be used with the analogy of a car. Using the analogy in the article there is the driver, vehicle itself, and the individual parts. Now applying it to my real-world experience we can use the analogy of rugby. So, in systems thinking we would look at the team as a whole. If we lose a rugby match the system's thinking approach would look at the whole team as the reason for failing. A more traditional thinking approach would look at individual players' mistakes as the cause for failure. As a team and a whole system, we have more than just players, we have coaches and trainers, and we spend lots of time together practicing, lifting, and playing.  And when there's a problem a system's thinking approach looks at all the pieces and how they work together over time, versus linear approach focuses on one aspect at a time.  </p>

               Going back to complex digital systems, it's important to use a model-based approach. Just like in rugby there are multiple players on the field. When looking at digital systems there are multiple components such as software, hardware, and users. Because there are so many different moving components you want to look at complex digital systems as a whole and not just individual parts. As we learn in the article, the goal of digital systems is to develop a successful system in using a model-based approach. It helps ensure that all the components are taken into account rather than must looking into individual pieces. The model-based approach is the blueprint that provides the key details for success.  </p>

         <!-- Module 2.2 Blog Post Starts here --> Memory and Mental models influence user interaction by the memorys role in user interaction. The users rely on short-term and long-term memory when interacting with interfaces. Short term memory holds limited information for brief periods. Long term memory stores learned patterns like knowing that a trash can icon means “delete”. Weh nan interface requires users to remember too much, such as steps from previous screens or unclear symbols, cognitive load increase and performance suffers. Secondly mental models are a user's internal understanding pf how a system works, often based on past experiences with similar products or real-world objects. If an app mirrors a user's mental model the system feels intuitive.  

Interface consistency and systems feedback improve usability. Interface consistency is in design elements, navigation structure, and terminology and layout. It helps users predict what will happen next, transfer knowledge from one part of the system to another and reduce learning time and error rates. The feedback shows systems have received and processed a user's action like, success: Your order has been placed. This is important because it builds trust, helps users feel control, and aids in error recovery.  

Cognitive demands refer to the mental effort a user must exert to understand and interact with a system or interface. High cognitive demands can result in user frustration and longer task completion times. Some common sources of cognitive load cluttered interfaces and poor labeling or ambiguous icons. Some stragies to reduce cognitive load is simplifying the interface by using clear, concise language and group related elements together. Progressive disclosure shows only essential information upfront revealing more as needed. Familiar patterns use industry-standard symbols, terms, and layouts. Task-oriented design guided users through actions with visual cues and step-by-step flows.  

Some interface roles of consistency reduce the need for users to relearn interface elements on different screens or devices. The benefit of consistency builds user confidence and reduces learning time. The role of feedback in user experience refers to the system's response to user actions, it reassures users that their input was received and understood. The types of feedback are visual, auditory, haptic, system. These are important because they help users recover from mistakes and reinforce correct behavior.  

Tesler's law is also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity. You can eliminate complexity entirely from a system or task, you can choose who handles it, the design or developer or user. Complexity is necessary to accomplish a task. The designer's job is to minimize how much complexity the user must deal with. And a great design takes time, it hides the complexity through automation, defaults, smart algorithms, and clear workflows.
