            <h3>What Systems Thinking is:</h3>
            <p>Systems Thinking is the thought process that comes with Systems Engineering, so to define Systems Thinking we must first define Systems Engineering, Systems Engineering Demystified defines Systems Engineering in its first pages rather succinctly as “The realization of successful systems” (Holt, 2023). Using this definition, we can extrapolate the definition of Systems Thinking as ‘The imagination and designing of systems’ the simplicity grants the width that is needed to truly define Systems Thinking. Where systems engineering is the process of making a functional system, system thinking is the thought process that encourages the creation of successful systems. </p>
            <h3>How Systems Thinking is different:</h3>
            <p>Where more traditional problem solving methods focus more heavily on the problem and the direct causes, System Thinking looks at the entire architecture of a situation instead of breaking it up into sections. An example would be if you take a vehicle like a car take it apart and look at each part individually, that would be an example of more traditional ways of looking at issues, a focus on parts and not the whole. Systems Thinking instead would look at the car as a whole unit, how it functions and what it does, it would analyze where problem points are in the entire care not just for individual faults in parts. “Systems Thinkers have taught us that a system is a product of the interaction of its parts, not just the sum of its parts.” (Dowdall, 2019) is the summarization of what the root difference that Systems Thinking represents from other methods of viewing the world.</p>
            <h3>What is Model Based Systems Engineering:</h3>
            <p>The Model Based Approach of Systems Engineering is as the ‘of’ indicates a method of performing Systems Engineering by using models, “a simplified abstraction of something--a graphical, mathematical, or physical representation that abstracts reality to eliminate some complexity.” (Nataliya, 2020). Using models when engineering systems makes understanding complex systems easier for the people making them, making the overall system more coherent. The model system does not just make creation easier, it also makes communicating function easier by enabling the creation of ‘views’, which are collections of information relevant to the different stakeholders of a system, a stakeholder is a person or organization that has an interest (or stake) in the system. With these ideas in mind, good use cases for Model Based Systems Engineering would be when a system needs to be designed with high complexity while also needing to be understood by those not directly involved with the creation of the system in question.</p>
            <p>Model Based Systems Engineering as a concept is broken down into three major chunks, Approach, Goal, and Visualization, Holt provides a great summary of each facet in Systems Engineering Demystified (2023). Approach involves firstly the Framework, which defines the structure, content, and consistency of the information put into the Model. The Framework is informed by the Process Set which is where the ‘where’ of the information is determined. The Frameworks content is determined by Viewpoint and Ontology, Viewpoint is a set of answers determined when View is determined, who is interested, why they are interested, and what information are the three big parts of a Viewpoint. Goal is the next section of Model Based System Engineering, made up of View, Model, and System, View is the data itself that informs the Model and the Diagram through the answering of the questions from Viewpoint. 
               The Model part is all Views compiled into a cohesive whole, an overview if you want to be funny about it. The System section is the end product what the entire process is working to create. Visualization is the last major chunk, made up of Notation and Diagram. Notation is the language used to communicate information, be it written or illustrated. Diagram is the application of Notation into a communication medium, a document or picture itself. There are a couple more sections attached to these three main chunks, but they are parts that are either used to create (Tools) or parts that ensure things are how they should be (Best Practices).</p>
            <h3>Complex Digital Systems and Model Based Approach:</h3>
            <p>All of that information is necessary to understand how Model Based System Engineering can be used to build digital systems of high complexity. Much in the same way that Model Based System Engineering can be used to map out a city wide bus network, it can be used to abstract a digital system in a way that is more understandable than the raw code and files that would exist otherwise. To illustrate why a Model Based Approach is useful we will compare it with an approach on the opposite side of the thought process, a Document Based Approach. Lets take the bus network idea, with documents the system design will be mostly made of typed information and spreadsheets of numbers. While this is functional there are issues of relevant data being lost in a pile of unrelated documents which can slow down the overall project and make the end result worse when implementing it into physical use in an actual city.
                Applying this to the creation of a digital system would make it all worse, the only people able to understand each part of the system being made would be the ones actively working on the sections in question, backend developers understanding the code but not the user interface, frontend developers understanding the user interface but not the code that makes it function correctly. It would create a kluged together mess that would function but not as efficiently as it would if it was created with more clarity of vision shared between the various team members. On the other hand, if a Model Based Approach was used there would be maps and physical models made of the city that the bus route is being designed for, this would grant the ability for each team member to convey ideas for bus stop placement and so that the possible traffic issues that routes could have would be seen a bit easier.
                 By applying this to the digital there would be mockups of what the end result should look like so that everyone on the team has an idea of what they are working towards. There would also be lists of what different user groups (Stakeholders) might be expecting to find within the project, an example would be that advertisers would expect places set aside for their ads to be displayed, users would be looking for the ads in question to be non-invasive. A Model Based Approach would make balancing all of the expectations more manageable for a design team and make the end product more put together and coherent in the end.</p>
