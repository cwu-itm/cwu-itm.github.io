        <h3>Model-Based Systems Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          Systems engineering expands from the beginning of human development of systems. In the 20th century it was redefined by Ludwig von Bertalanffy as general systems theory. Its foundational approach is understanding the relationship between the critical parts of a system and its connection with other systems rather than following the approach of isolation.
        </p>

        <h3>System Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          System thinking is the practice of inspecting technical problems not as stationary but more as a pattern of interaction. The idea is to understand a system’s response based on how each component functions together. This approach is essential because systems are often non-linear and dynamic, meaning that small changes in one area can lead to unexpected consequences across the entire network (The Interaction Design Foundation, 2025). By shifting focus from individual parts to the relationships between them, practitioners can better anticipate these "feedback loops" and create more resourceful solutions (The Interaction Design Foundation, 2025).
        </p>

        <h3>Traditional & Linear Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          The traditional way of thinking evolves around knowing the location of where the system requires abstraction. Although it can be pictured as complex, it relies on the linear approach which focuses more on the cause-and-effect method reducing each element in pieces to understand a system, but the key is to dissect the components. While it can make things worse, it also lacks complexity, and these features can be seen and addressed through system thinking using the model-based approach.
        </p>

        <h3>Model Based Approach</h3>
        <p>
          The Model based approach is best to handle such challenges as there's been a shift in systems, to a now a digital complex method. Complex digital system design implements model-based systems engineering (MBSE) to manage text-based specification constraints through its systematic system development framework. Holt (2021) explains that modeling functions as a key link between system descriptions and system deployment because it shows how system components operate together in both operational and physical environments.

        <h2>Thinking in Life Cycles</h2>
        <p>By: Jose Garcia</p>

    </header>

    <section>
        <p>Digital systems operating today require a systematic approach which spans their entire operational period from requirement definition to system retirement. The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) serves as the core framework which systems engineering uses according to this research. The analysis uses industry standards and structured life cycle models to establish the SDLC framework which includes a detailed evaluation of linear and iterative and incremental models. This research examines how life cycle thinking enables designers to create digital systems which maintain their original design intent while sustaining themselves throughout time and adapting to technological advancements in modern fast-paced technological environment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A system in systems engineering and software development exists as a dynamic entity which has a limited time span before it reaches its end of life. The SDLC serves organizations as their method to manage the complex process of creating and maintaining these systems. This structured approach results in high-quality products that meet customer requirements at a higher level than expected while completing projects both on time and under budget (TechTarget, n.d.). The selection of appropriate project methods depends on understanding three main models which include linear and iterative and incremental approaches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Defining the Systems Development Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>The Systems Development Life Cycle follows the system development process through multiple defined stages. The six core stages of a standard life cycle include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conception:</strong> The identifying phase where stakeholders establish requirements and define project boundaries to ensure the proposal is feasible (Intellectsoft, n.d.).</li>
            <li><strong>Development:</strong> Designers create the system, identify solutions, and break the system down into subsystems and components.</li>
            <li><strong>Production:</strong> The realization phase involving actual coding and building, where verification ensures the system matches technical requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilization:</strong> The system is deployed and validated to confirm it addresses the user problem it was designed to solve.</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Ongoing maintenance, bug fixing, and help-desk assistance that allows the system to adjust to environmental changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Retirement:</strong> The end of the life cycle marking decommissioning, requiring protected asset removal and data migration.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Linear Life Cycle Models</h3>
        <p>The linear life cycle model follows the "Waterfall" approach, a sequential process requiring stage-by-stage completion before starting the next stage.</p>
        <h4>Characteristics, Advantages, and Drawbacks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Follows a strict framework where each stage produces results used as input for the next; requirements must stay constant.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easy to understand and manage because progress is clearly visible against a timeline.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Keeping parameters fixed is a major limitation; detecting errors late in the cycle is difficult and costly to correct (TechTarget, n.d.).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Iterative Life Cycle Models</h3>
        <p>The iterative model consists of multiple recurring phases which construct the system through continuous loops instead of a single sequence.</p>
        <h4>Characteristics, Advantages, and Drawbacks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Teams create a fundamental version, evaluate it, and improve it in the following cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Flexible approach allowing for continuous feedback; serves as the base for Agile methodologies (Intellectsoft, n.d.).</li>
            <li><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Challenging to manage from a budgetary and scheduling perspective; can lead to "analysis paralysis".</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Incremental Life Cycle Models</h3>
        <p>The incremental model breaks system development into separate functional components known as increments.</p>
        <h4>Characteristics, Advantages, and Drawbacks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Increments are developed and delivered in stages; a partial version may be in use while the next is in development.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Early delivery of value; users do not have to wait for the entire system to be finished to start using critical features.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Architectural integrity is a primary challenge; if the first design isn't strong, the system may become a collection of disconnected patches.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>The Importance of Life Cycle Thinking</h3>
        <p>Life cycle thinking drives digital system design and sustainability. Designers who evaluate Support and Retirement stages during the Conception phase develop systems with simpler maintenance processes. This is inherently tied to the Technology Life Cycle (Research, Ascent, Maturity, Decline); planning for updates enables systems to transition smoothly when technologies reach their end of life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The Systems Development Life Cycle serves as the core methodology enabling professionals to manage complex modern engineering operations. Managing digital systems from beginning to end of service helps organizations create systems that survive through time while remaining strong against technological changes.</p>

        <h1>Designing for the Human Element</h1>

        <h2>Designing for the Human Element</h2>
        <p>Designers who focus on human needs develop functional tools for the digital world, but other designers produce interfaces which users find easy to use. <strong>Human-Centered Design (HCD)</strong> philosophy shifts its focus from technical requirements to study how users experience products in their everyday activities. Designing for people requires architects to function as psychological architects who create spaces which honor the built-in human restrictions that affect how we perceive and focus and store information. Designers who merge empathy with cognitive science methods will develop interfaces which extend human behavior in a natural way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Foundation of Human-Centered Design</h2>
        <p>Human-Centered Design serves as a design method which surpasses UI rules because designers need to develop empathetic abilities. As noted in the <em>Field Guide to Human-Centered Design</em>, HCD is "the backbone of our work" because it ensures that the solutions created are desired by the people they are meant to serve (<a href="https://www.designkit.org/resources/1" target="_blank">IDEO.org, 2015</a>, p. 9). Designers need to experience the user environment to discover hidden requirements through this design method.</p>
        
        <p>The human-first approach receives direction from two main frameworks which serve as its foundation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The international standard <strong>ISO 9241-210</strong> provides a technical framework which directs organizations to use an iterative process consisting of observation, requirement-setting, and evaluation (<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/77520.html" target="_blank">ISO, 2019</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>IDEO's Field Guide</strong> offers a social perspective focused on the mindsets of design, emphasizing three phases: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Perception and the Power of Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Designers must understand how humans organize visual information to guide their attention effectively. Without a clear <strong>visual hierarchy</strong>, users experience cognitive overload. Visual hierarchy uses size, color, and contrast to signal importance.</p>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/visual-hierarchy" target="_blank">Justinmind (n.d.)</a>, designers use scanning patterns like the <strong>F-Pattern</strong> or <strong>Z-Pattern</strong> to place critical information where the eye naturally lands. By utilizing high color contrast on primary buttons, designers exploit biological shortcuts, allowing the human eye to find important elements without having to "hunt" for them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Universal Laws of the User Experience</h2>
        <p>To ensure consistency, designers utilize established UX laws that reflect human cognitive behavior, as detailed in the <a href="https://lawsofux.com/" target="_blank">Laws of UX</a>:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jakob's Law</strong> suggests that users spend the vast majority of their time on other websites and apps. Consequently, they prefer your site to work exactly like the ones they already know (Yablonski, n.d.). When a designer uses a magnifying glass icon for "Search," they are practicing empathy by not forcing the user to learn a new visual language.</li>
            <li><strong>Fitts's Law</strong> states that the time required to move to a target depends on the distance to that target and the size of the target. In modern UI design, this means making primary action buttons large and placing them in easily accessible regions, such as the bottom of a mobile screen where a user's thumb naturally rests (Yablonski, n.d.).</li>
            <li><strong>Hick's Law</strong> dictates that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. In a human-centered approach, designers avoid "overwhelming" the user. Instead of presenting twenty options simultaneously, they might use "progressive disclosure"—showing only the most necessary information first—to keep the user’s cognitive load manageable.</li>
            <li><strong>Miller's Law</strong> asserts that the average person can only keep roughly seven (plus or minus two) items in their working memory. Designers use chunking as their method to achieve this goal by breaking down information into smaller sections. The user experience becomes better when registration forms extend across multiple sections because these sections divide the process into smaller steps which help users achieve a sense of accomplishment instead of feeling fatigued (Yablonski, n.d.).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Ultimately, designing for people means acknowledging that we will not get it right on the first try. The IDEO framework supports the concept that "iteration is the best way to get it right" because designers can improve their products through direct human feedback according to IDEO.org (2015, p. 21). The combination of ISO 9241-210 standards with UX laws psychological knowledge enables us to develop digital environments which both look great and show proper respect for their human users.</p>
