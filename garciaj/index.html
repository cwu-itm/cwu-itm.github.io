        <h3>Model-Based Systems Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          Systems engineering expands from the beginning of human development of systems. In the 20th century it was redefined by Ludwig von Bertalanffy as general systems theory. Its foundational approach is understanding the relationship between the critical parts of a system and its connection with other systems rather than following the approach of isolation.
        </p>

        <h3>System Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          System thinking is the practice of inspecting technical problems not as stationary but more as a pattern of interaction. The idea is to understand a system’s response based on how each component functions together. This approach is essential because systems are often non-linear and dynamic, meaning that small changes in one area can lead to unexpected consequences across the entire network (The Interaction Design Foundation, 2025). By shifting focus from individual parts to the relationships between them, practitioners can better anticipate these "feedback loops" and create more resourceful solutions (The Interaction Design Foundation, 2025).
        </p>

        <h3>Traditional & Linear Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          The traditional way of thinking evolves around knowing the location of where the system requires abstraction. Although it can be pictured as complex, it relies on the linear approach which focuses more on the cause-and-effect method reducing each element in pieces to understand a system, but the key is to dissect the components. While it can make things worse, it also lacks complexity, and these features can be seen and addressed through system thinking using the model-based approach.
        </p>

        <h3>Model Based Approach</h3>
        <p>
          The Model based approach is best to handle such challenges as there's been a shift in systems, to a now a digital complex method. Complex digital system design implements model-based systems engineering (MBSE) to manage text-based specification constraints through its systematic system development framework. Holt (2021) explains that modeling functions as a key link between system descriptions and system deployment because it shows how system components operate together in both operational and physical environments.
