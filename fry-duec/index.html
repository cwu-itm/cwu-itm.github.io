            <h3>
               A Complete System Is More Than the Sum of Its Parts.
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Systems thinking is a design philosophy that focuses not only on the elements that make up a system but also on the relationships between them (Crawley, 2022). To put it more clearly, the ways in which elements interact with, and influence each other is the focus of systems thinking just as much as the literal components that make up the system. Systems thinking can help people understand their role in a wider sense (Holt, 2021, p. 57). Using systems thinking we can become more effective designers, ensuring that all components within a system perform at max capacity and using past failures as learning opportunities rather than as an end point.

            <h3>
               Systems Thinking in Action
            </h3>
               <p>
                  To understand system thinking in play, one can think of the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone. Originally, gray wolves in the Yellowstone area were hunted to extinction by ranchers worried about their livestock in the early 1900s (Peglar, 2022). However, without the wolves, the local ecosystem took a sharp turn. Without pressure from predators to stay on the move, elk would overgraze one area before going to the next (Peglar, 2022). As a result of overgraze, plant mass around the park took a sharp decline (Peglar, 2022). The extinction of wolves within the park caused a harsh domino effect that caused harm to even the most unexpected groups. Despite what on the surface seems like a good deal to the wolf’s prey animal, elk; it actually caused a sharp decline overtime for the elk population as well, as it was now at a third of what it was before the absence of wolves (Peglar, 2022).

            <h3>
               Systems Thinking Vs. Linear Thinking
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Systems thinking leads to deeper analysis than ordinary linear thinking. Systems thinking carefully considers the role of each element within a system. The role of each element, how one element affects another, causality, the hierarchy of elements. Rather than examining an incident at face value, systems thinking digs deeper into the why and how of what something is. Understanding the deeper reasons behind a consequence and gaining more perspective will leave one more informed.

               What Is MBSE And How It Can Be Used to Create Complex Digital Systems
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Model-based systems engineering, or MBSE, is a design methodology that focuses on using domain models as the primary means of documenting information (Holt, 2021, p. 32). A domain model is the visual representation of a system, documenting elements and the relationships between them (Holt, 2021, p. 40). MSBE also takes advantage of data modeling to help design new systems (Holt, 2021, p. 51). Using models to simulate systems allows engineers to verify and adjust plans as needed.  MSBE replaces old approaches and focuses on retaining a clear centralized source of information for future references. Systems thinking is an accompanying method of thought that approaches the same concepts as MSBE. Used in conjunction, these approaches are best for creating complex digital systems.

            <h3>
               Conclusion
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Systems thinking is useful not only for technical applications but also for anyone who wishes to gain a greater understanding of something. Systems thinking puts equal importance on the relationship between separate elements just as much as the literal elements themselves. Engineers using the MBSE approach gain the most insight from using systems thinking to design projects and understand simulated results. Life is made up of interconnected events that decide our fates, systems thinking not only seeks to understand a conclusion but all factors that create a domino effect of cause and effect.
