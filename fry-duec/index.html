            <h3>
               A Complete System Is More Than the Sum of Its Parts.
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Systems thinking is a design philosophy that focuses not only on the elements that make up a system but also on the relationships between them (Crawley, 2022). To put it more clearly, the ways in which elements interact with, and influence each other is the focus of systems thinking just as much as the literal components that make up the system. Systems thinking can help people understand their role in a wider sense (Holt, 2021, p. 57). Using systems thinking we can become more effective designers, ensuring that all components within a system perform at max capacity and using past failures as learning opportunities rather than as an end point.
               </p>
            <h3>
               Systems Thinking in Action
            </h3>
               <p>
                  To understand system thinking in play, one can think of the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone. Originally, gray wolves in the Yellowstone area were hunted to extinction by ranchers worried about their livestock in the early 1900s (Peglar, 2022). However, without the wolves, the local ecosystem took a sharp turn. Without pressure from predators to stay on the move, elk would overgraze one area before going to the next (Peglar, 2022). As a result of overgraze, plant mass around the park took a sharp decline (Peglar, 2022). The extinction of wolves within the park caused a harsh domino effect that caused harm to even the most unexpected groups. Despite what on the surface seems like a good deal to the wolf’s prey animal, elk; it actually caused a sharp decline overtime for the elk population as well, as it was now at a third of what it was before the absence of wolves (Peglar, 2022).

            <h3>
               Systems Thinking Vs. Linear Thinking
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Systems thinking leads to deeper analysis than ordinary linear thinking. Systems thinking carefully considers the role of each element within a system. The role of each element, how one element affects another, causality, the hierarchy of elements. Rather than examining an incident at face value, systems thinking digs deeper into the why and how of what something is. Understanding the deeper reasons behind a consequence and gaining more perspective will leave one more informed.
               </p>
            <h3>
               What Is MBSE And How It Can Be Used to Create Complex Digital Systems
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Model-based systems engineering, or MBSE, is a design methodology that focuses on using domain models as the primary means of documenting information (Holt, 2021, p. 32). A domain model is the visual representation of a system, documenting elements and the relationships between them (Holt, 2021, p. 40). MSBE also takes advantage of data modeling to help design new systems (Holt, 2021, p. 51). Using models to simulate systems allows engineers to verify and adjust plans as needed.  MSBE replaces old approaches and focuses on retaining a clear centralized source of information for future references. Systems thinking is an accompanying method of thought that approaches the same concepts as MSBE. Used in conjunction, these approaches are best for creating complex digital systems.
               </p>
            <h3>
               Conclusion
            </h3>
               <p>
                  Systems thinking is useful not only for technical applications but also for anyone who wishes to gain a greater understanding of something. Systems thinking puts equal importance on the relationship between separate elements just as much as the literal elements themselves. Engineers using the MBSE approach gain the most insight from using systems thinking to design projects and understand simulated results. Life is made up of interconnected events that decide our fates, systems thinking not only seeks to understand a conclusion but all factors that create a domino effect of cause and effect.

            <h3>
               What Is the System Development Life Cycle?
            </h3>
               <p>The system development Life Cycle, or SDLC, is a design framework used for developing systems. It serves not only as a set of guidelines for system development but also as a method of thought when designing a system. It guides the developmental process through conceiving, designing, building, deploying, and ultimately retiring an information system or software application (Holt, 2021, p. 136). At its heart, SDLC is a development map that breaks down clearly the many steps and stages that goes into system development. </p>
               <p>While there is variation between specific individual models, SDLC generally encompasses the entire life cycle of a system from birth to death. Using SDLC as a methodology shifts from viewing a system or product as a static entity to a dynamic entity with a lifespan that will grow and adapt.</p>
               <p>Defining a system’s life cycle is critical not only for development, but also for economic purposes such as designing proposals for procurement. This is called Procurement Life Cycle, or PLC. In cases where a developer is buying a subsystem from a buyer, such as a plan manufacturer buying the wheels from a bidder, a PLC defines this interaction within its framework (Holt, 2021, p. 138). SDLC is an important documentation when it comes to defining a system for potential buyers.</p>            
            <h3>
               The Linear Model
            </h3>
               <p>The Linear Model, or the Waterfall Model, is as the name describes: a linear model that focuses on a phase approach to designing a system (GeeksforGeeks, 2018). Each phase is completed one by one, in a sequential fashion with little room for backtracking or change when a phase is complete (GeeksforGeeks, 2018). Each phase has strong requirements that require it to be finished completely and documented extensively before moving on to the next phase. There is strong emphasis on planning ahead and being upfront about any requirements. The model assumes a high degree of stability when designing, so any requirements need to be outlined early on before any progress is made (GeeksforGeeks, 2018). Progress flows, like a waterfall, with minimal room for change.</p>
               <p>The simplistic nature of the linear model is its best strength but also can be its biggest downfall. Systems that need to adapt constantly to dynamic environments are not well suited to the linear model. On the other hand, a system that exists within a stable environment with well outlined requirements and specifications will thrive when developed with the linear model.</p>
            <h3>
               The Iterative Model
            </h3>
               <p>The Iterative Model is a model of SDLC that focuses on building complexity on an initial simplified design (AirBrake, 2016). Instead of a singular pass through the standard life cycle stages like the linear model, a system designed with the linear model will go through several (Holt, 2021, p. 146). After the initial planning phase, a select few phases will be repeated until the final iteration. Once a cycle is completed then the current iteration will be thoroughly evaluated. This evaluation includes examining an iteration’s current effectiveness and complexity after which it will be decided if another iteration will be created or not.</p>
               <p>There are many advantages to which the iterative model has. For digital systems, most already use a form of the iterative model with versioning updates (AirBrake, 2016). The iterative model makes this form of updating easier because it is designed around a form of this occurrence. The iterative model also makes turnaround for the planning phase to the working system faster. Unlike the linear model which has very extensive phases, each stage in the iterative model is comparatively much faster and therefore it is quicker at producing a working design. Another advantage of the iterative model is its adaptability; dynamic conditions can be modified to suit ever-changing requirements. New iterations can be created in a shorter timeframe than other models allow and can also be reverted back to an older functional version if required (AirBrake, 2016).</p>
               <p>For all the advantages that the iterative model has, it is not a perfect design model for every system. In fact, there are many disadvantages to using the iterative model instead of a different SDLC model. The iterative model in particular struggles with late-stage issues as a result of minimal planning compared to other models. A system designed with the iterative model might need several iterations to solve an issue that a more substantial planning phase might have avoided. Another issue that the iterative model struggles with is feature creep. As successive iterations pile up, the late-stage designs become far out of the scope of what was initially planned.</p>
            <h3>
               The Incremental Model
            </h3>
               <p>The Incremental Model is a model that focuses on designing a system in small parts that build upon each other (Holt, 2021, p. 148). The incremental model and the iterative model are similar in approach in that they both focus on building upon a functional version until a system design is finalized (Holt, 2021, p. 148). Each increment phase adds extended functionality to a system that builds as more incremental progress is made. The incremental model can be compared to making a house room by room, where each room is complete. </p>
               <p>The incremental model works well for systems that can deliver some functionality before the final version is finished (Holt, 2021, p. 149). A system can be released in an incomplete, but functional state, to consumers faster. This provides tangible value to a system faster than other models allow, bringing in more cash for system development. The incremental model also allows for reduction in scope; if a system’s development is canceled then it still has value as a functioning product.</p>
               <p>Despite the advantages that the incremental model brings, it also has its drawbacks. The incremental model requires more upfront planning and work before other models. Poor foresight will lead to headaches when adding new increments and the system will feel unharmonious. Increments must also be implemented carefully as to not break the functionality of previous progress. </p>
            <h3>
               The importance of Life Cycle Thinking
            </h3>
               <p>Life Cycle Thinking, or LCT, is an essential methodology for building a successful system. It is useful not only as a framework for building a successful system but also as a crucial mindset for the future of design, sustainability and evolution of digital systems.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><strong>Design</strong></li>
  <li>Life cycle thinking forces designers to consider their product at each stage of its life, beyond its immediate functionality. How a system will be maintained, how it will scale and how it will keep relevancy. Creating with a system’s entire life cycle makes designers make higher quality products that account for the inconvenient questions like disposal and repair with as much care as functionality. Designing a product is not only for its useable life but also for its eventual irrelevancy.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustainability</strong></li>
  <li>Sustainability is often a forgotten quality when it comes to designing a system. Sustainability in LCT encompasses a wide variety of topics. From system longevity to energy efficiency, and to product end of life. LCT focuses on responsible system retirement whether it pertains to responsible hardware disposal, or to data archival.</li>
  <li><strong>Evolution of Digital Systems</strong></li>
  <li>Using SDLC as framework for development forces designers to confront the full commitment that comes with system development. It mandates designers look at the full picture, encouraging more long-term commitments over short-term ones. By utilizing LCT, designers of digital systems can avoid late term issues by planning ahead for the system’s entire life cycle. This ensures more reliable outcomes and that systems created are better suited by the models they are created with.</li>
</ul>  
         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p>The Systems Development Life Cycle, provides an essential framework for creating systems that ensure better outcomes in development and beyond. The choice between which model to employ for development comes down to the specific needs of that system and the contextual environment in which it is being used in. Modern product development requires the strategic use of Life Cycle Thinking to reach the full potential of what a product can achieve. By adopting LCT, designers and organizations can ensure that systems are not only built for its launch but also for longevity and evolution. Ensuring digital systems can deliver sustained value and adapt to a changing world.</p>

               <h2>Module 2.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>What is Human-Centered Design?</h3>
               <p>The act of creation often involves accounting for how others will interact with it. Human made designs shape our modern world and how we live within it. Despite this reality, many products are oftentimes hard to use or unwieldly when they could be better. Human-Centered Design (HCD) is both a way of thinking for designers as well as a framework for how to make products, services and systems that can reach people the best. Products made with HCD in mind are made with understanding of a user’s context, needs, and capabilities. By using HCD products can be made to reach a targeted demographic more effectively than similar competing products by making them with that audience in mind. HCD leads to innovations that would otherwise go undiscovered if the product was made without it.</p>
               <p> To explore HCD, it can be examined through multiple lenses. ISO 9241-210 defines HCD through a unified framework that works as an international standard. IDEO’S Field Guide, in contrast, defines HCD less like a step-by-step framework and more as a philosophical mindset that can be cultivated through understanding fundamental guidelines. ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide both function as fundamental guides. When used together, a designer can complete a full understanding of HCD. </p>            
            <h3>ISO 9241-210 Perspective</h3>
                <p>ISO 9241-210 also titled: “Ergonomics of human-system interaction—Part 210: Human-centered design for interactive systems”, is a process that describes how to create systems with good usability (Robier, 2016, pp. 81–88).  This process places users in the center of development progress. The goal of this process is to create designs that emphasize the suitability of its creation to the user. To this end, a fundamental guideline of ISO 9241-210 is to build understanding of the target demographic by directly involving the specified audience in the development process (Robier, 2016, pp. 81–88). This is done by collecting feedback, interviewing subjects, and testing prototypes with the target users. Through this process, development teams will gain perspective about user requirements. The process tests the perspectives of the development team to think about a product in terms of usability for an audience rather than just the product itself. </p>
                <p>This is a separate framework that works well with the previous subject: System Development Life Cycles (SDLC). The HCD framework that ISO 9241-210 describes shares many common stages with the popular SDLC frameworks but recontextualizes them in the name of usability. It’s an adaptable framework that can be easily adapted to and integrated into whatever SDLC framework that is being used. Whether it is a Linear development method or an agile development method that is being used, HCD can be easily accommodated and used within the scope of development.</p>
            <h3>IDEO’s Field Guide Perspective</h3>
            <p>IDEO in contrast to ISO 9241- 210 breaks away from rigid frameworks and asks readers to understand HCD as a philosophy (IDEO, 2015, pp. 9–25). IDEO’S approach to HCD is less practical than ISO 9241 -210 but much more focused on human connection and empathy. In IDEO’s Field Guide, there are three main stages to HCD described: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation (IDEO, 2015, pp. 9–25). Inspiration involves learning of a problem that people have that you want to solve. Ideation is the stage where you generate ideas and designs as something that could help solve the problem. Implementation is bringing that idea to life and maximizing its impact in reality. </p>
            <h3>Visual Perception and Usability</h3>
                <P>Visual perception is usually the first stage in which a user interacts with a product. Apart from audio-based systems and blind users, Visual hierarchy is the introduction to a product that informs a user how they are supposed to interact with it.  If a control panel is littered with tens of individual non-distinct buttons, then a user might be confused on what to do with it. If that same control panel also had a big red button, that differed in size and color from other buttons, then users would then assume that button is responsible for the most important function. </P>
                <P>Visual perception is the ability to make sense of what we are seeing. Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements that guide our attention and direct us to important elements (Akindunjoye, 2019). The previous example of the control panel is an example meant to show the importance of visual perception and hierarchy. To see another example of visual hierarchy in play, open up your phone and look at any news article. The title will be in bold and in a larger font compared to the main body of the text (Akindunjoye, 2019). This is to catch your attention and interest the reader in reading the rest of the article. The visual aspect of a design is paramount to the usability of a design. </P>
                <P>In HCD, the readability of a design is often specific to a user’s culture. An example of this being the reading of the color red. In America, we have past associations, stop sights and traffic lights, with red that make us associate it with emergency. In contrast, eastern Asian countries read the color red as lucky and associate it with good fortune. It is important to be specific regarding visual design with the target demographic you are designing a product for.</P>
            <h3>UX Laws and HCD</h3>
            <p>HCD is design with a focus on the usability to its user at the core. The principles of human psychology regarding visual design are well-documented. By utilizing a scientific approach to HCD, designers can better understand the needs of the user and make a better product.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><strong>Jakob’s Law</strong></li>
  <li>Jakob’s Law is a law of UX that essentially states that users will approach your product in the same way they approach similar products, and they will prefer it to be something they are already familiar with (Yablonski, 2024, pg. 1). HCD already approaches this by emphasizing the need to understand the user’s context, or what they are used to.  An example of this law in action is the near universal placing of a shopping cart icon in the top right corner of a website. Most websites use this placement because it is what users expect and where they go to look at their carts. Users don’t want to spend extra time searching for what should be a single glance. By understanding Jakob’s Law, HCD designers can make better decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Fitts’s Law</strong></li>
  <li>Fitt’s Law states that “The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.”  (Yablonski, 2024, pg. 15). What this means is that important functions or elements should be more easily accessible the more essential they are. An example of this would be a smartphone’s touchscreen.  The most important elements should be placed closer to the center of the phone so that users can more easily see and use those functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Hick’s Law</strong></li>
  <li>Hick’s Law states that the more complex a decision a user is expected to make is, the more time it will take for the user to make that decision (Yablonski, 2024, pg. 39). HCD’s approach to this law is to create designs that are simple and intuitive to a user’s needs. HCD seeks to simplify complexity in favor of usability and efficiency. Some products are created that require complexity in decision-making but assist the user in making the presentation and use of a product as simple as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Miller’s Law</strong></li>
<li>Miller’s Law states that the average user can only keep about seven items, give or take, in their working memory (Yablonski, 2024, pg. 29). For example, in the beginning of a card-matching game where players flip over cards and attempt to find matching pairs, before the game starts users might make mental note of some cards and their placements. Despite seeing the placement of every card at the beginning of the game, most players will not remember where every card is and have to rely on working memory throughout the game to finish. For HCD designers, this law means that designers shouldn’t create designs that are too complex for users to remember to know what to do with. Instead designs should be created that help users break down and process smaller bits of information that build up instead of requiring too much new knowledge upfront.</li>
</ul>  
         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p>Human-Centered Design is the act of designing with users in mind. Beyond creating products that simply satisfy a function, HCD creates products that have users at the center of its success. ISO 9241-210 and IDEO both have differing methodologies on how to go about designing with humans in mind but at their heart act as accompanying methods to assist designers in making the best product possible. HCD works best when utilized with scientific evidence as accompaniment. The psychology of people’s minds has many key characteristics that make learning about the interaction between design and the mind worthwhile.</p>
