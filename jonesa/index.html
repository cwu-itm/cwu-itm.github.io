            <h3>SYSTEMS THINKING:</h3>
            <p>In the grand scheme of systems, thinking is the process of how people perceive ideas. Jon Holt stated that people define systems differently from one another depending on the nature (Holt, 2023). As people should being entitled to their own interpretation on what system is to them. There are five different categories if you will on systems varying on physical, extraterrestrial, experimentation, environmental, and socially (Holt, 2023). I interpret systems in comparison to football teams. The head coach being the “system” players being “system of interest” “enabling system” are the playbooks and “system elements” is the different positions. If one is out of alignment the entire system will not fulfill the specific functions intended. Systems are designed to provide efficient and positive results, but every system has its flaws. System engineers are responsible I feel to tend to problems that arise to maintain results. Because systems are designed to produce outcomes. I digress the education system was designed by people, and the idea was then brought to life. For these systems to come together to fruition, all the different elements need to be in place first. The structure from A-Z needs to be complete so that the process of setting up the system is thorough. At the head of every system is a “stakeholder “most of the time (Holt, 2023). Which can be an entity of some kind a car, tv, or software, then a person, organization and or business having interest in such entity (Holt, 2023). Like how the Seahawks and many other football teams are sponsored by Nike. The NFL organization has interest in the Nike system, so they use it for their players uniforms. Every system has attributes being height, weight, element numbers, and a name (Holt, 2023). These being just a couple of examples but in reference to it you also have timestamp and data structure attributes (Holt, 2023). To me it is like having different parts to a computer all serve their own purpose. Systems are intended to achieve goals but reaching goals has their requirements (Holt, 2023). Breaking it down further a system has a specific desire to pursue a function, features like cruise control as stated, of course the end goal of the purpose being fulfilled (Holt, 2023). For now, I will leave off with this as we transition, systems to be brought to life need action. Action produces the various elements of said system and eventually obtains its goal.</p>
            <h3>DIFFERENTIATION: </h3>
            <p> Furthermore, the differentiation of systems thinking and traditional linear ways of thinking. To be completely honest here as we dive in, I will learn more about what this means. In the article written by Daniel Johnson, a frontline engineer out of Truro, Cornwall, it compares the differentiation of linear and systems thinking. Linear thinking is a step-by-step process a straight line from point A to point B (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). When software engineers utilize “If-Then” statements when something of linear nature comes up to produce a sequence (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). I would sum it up by following a recipe like when you are cooking or baking. If you stick to the recipe everything should and will check out. Linear thinking is effective for smaller problems, predictable, and simple but it has limitations (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). I feel linear thinking would be effective when dealing with working inside a restaurant system. If you stay organized and work hard, then your results eventually will fall into place. As for dealing with more complex systems, this style of thinking probably would not be ideal. Considering the difficulty of the factors that would be in place in the technological arena. Contrasting towards systems thinking as discussed previously. This style of thinking involves interconnections of a system. Like navigation of a maze where a small turn can lead to an unexpected dead end (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Understanding why this is very important in technology helps us identify interactions between elements, entices innovation, and adaptation (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Making it easier and more efficient to pivot your direction to solve problems that have more complexity. Some examples in terms of technology include software development, networks, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, social media algorithms (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Obviously when you can manipulate something to get the results you want, it makes solving problems easy. But manipulating can also lead to other problems I feel as well depending on the person. Johnson talks about a “Ripple Effect” that I would like to mention because it makes sense. A software engineer for Snapchat develops a solution that is effective to solve multiple bugs with an update. But when said update is released to the public, users find it difficult to navigate the application now (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Johnson ended his argument with the hardest problems are the most complex linear thinking use effective however, system thinking has the necessary attributes to tackle most challenges (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Efficiency is personally what I appreciate the most when it comes to problem solving. </p>
            <h3>MODEL-BASED APPROACH:</h3>
            <p> Descending, I must ask myself why is a model-based approach applicable to the design of complex systems? Carnegie Mellon University out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will give us more insight into the answer to my question. Model-based approaches in the systems engineering world supports design, analysis, verification, and validation with the development of complex systems (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Model-based approaches are applicable to the development of complex systems due to the effectiveness. Because of software engineering I feel to use this more often with technology when covering a lot of information at one time. A digital modeling environment helps remove inconsistencies within, enforces standards by stakeholders, improves the analysis of systems, reduces defects and adds more windows for design and information (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Making the engineering side of things more manageable when dealing with complexity in a system (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). With the rise of artificial intelligence can and will indefinitely replace software engineering steps that people need to take. I am afraid that this might not be for the greater good if we are not careful. Dissecting what modeling means specifically in technology has four instruments if you will be being, language, structure, argumentation, and presentation (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Language dealing with the idea of the model, language being strict syntax rules, arguments are the relationship between the two, and presentations involve simulations (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). All serving their part when dealing with model-based systems thinking. Comparing to a science project you have your “language” or terminology, “structure” and equations/formulas, “arguments” as a thesis/objective, and “presentation” showing the class your work. Or in the case of the technology space, either an upper-level management person or the entire organization. Finally, the four quadrants model dives deep into linear versus systematic. In layman’s terms, operational logically is the problem description concept, the physical component is the actual problem itself, in tandem with system logical allocating system physicals solution (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Logical parts change overtime and physical changes are initiated by technological advancements (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). My final take on model-based approaches when dealing with complex digital systems I find very vast. But overall, the greatest option is when thinking about solutions to said complex digital systems. Due to the parameters that system engineering must live and breathe by. Using this model-based style can help reduce stress and workload when dealing with different difficulties. Especially when working with people in a huge organization with huge projects. </p>
