            <h3>SYSTEMS THINKING:</h3>
            <p>In the grand scheme of systems, thinking is the process of how people perceive ideas. Jon Holt stated that people define systems differently from one another depending on the nature (Holt, 2023). As people should being entitled to their own interpretation on what system is to them. There are five different categories if you will on systems varying on physical, extraterrestrial, experimentation, environmental, and socially (Holt, 2023). I interpret systems in comparison to football teams. The head coach being the “system” players being “system of interest” “enabling system” are the playbooks and “system elements” is the different positions. If one is out of alignment the entire system will not fulfill the specific functions intended. Systems are designed to provide efficient and positive results, but every system has its flaws. System engineers are responsible I feel to tend to problems that arise to maintain results. Because systems are designed to produce outcomes. I digress the education system was designed by people, and the idea was then brought to life. For these systems to come together to fruition, all the different elements need to be in place first. The structure from A-Z needs to be complete so that the process of setting up the system is thorough. At the head of every system is a “stakeholder “most of the time (Holt, 2023). Which can be an entity of some kind a car, tv, or software, then a person, organization and or business having interest in such entity (Holt, 2023). Like how the Seahawks and many other football teams are sponsored by Nike. The NFL organization has interest in the Nike system, so they use it for their players uniforms. Every system has attributes being height, weight, element numbers, and a name (Holt, 2023). These being just a couple of examples but in reference to it you also have timestamp and data structure attributes (Holt, 2023). To me it is like having different parts to a computer all serve their own purpose. Systems are intended to achieve goals but reaching goals has their requirements (Holt, 2023). Breaking it down further a system has a specific desire to pursue a function, features like cruise control as stated, of course the end goal of the purpose being fulfilled (Holt, 2023). For now, I will leave off with this as we transition, systems to be brought to life need action. Action produces the various elements of said system and eventually obtains its goal.</p>
            <h3>DIFFERENTIATION: </h3>
            <p> Furthermore, the differentiation of systems thinking and traditional linear ways of thinking. To be completely honest here as we dive in, I will learn more about what this means. In the article written by Daniel Johnson, a frontline engineer out of Truro, Cornwall, it compares the differentiation of linear and systems thinking. Linear thinking is a step-by-step process a straight line from point A to point B (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). When software engineers utilize “If-Then” statements when something of linear nature comes up to produce a sequence (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). I would sum it up by following a recipe like when you are cooking or baking. If you stick to the recipe everything should and will check out. Linear thinking is effective for smaller problems, predictable, and simple but it has limitations (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). I feel linear thinking would be effective when dealing with working inside a restaurant system. If you stay organized and work hard, then your results eventually will fall into place. As for dealing with more complex systems, this style of thinking probably would not be ideal. Considering the difficulty of the factors that would be in place in the technological arena. Contrasting towards systems thinking as discussed previously. This style of thinking involves interconnections of a system. Like navigation of a maze where a small turn can lead to an unexpected dead end (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Understanding why this is very important in technology helps us identify interactions between elements, entices innovation, and adaptation (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Making it easier and more efficient to pivot your direction to solve problems that have more complexity. Some examples in terms of technology include software development, networks, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, social media algorithms (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Obviously when you can manipulate something to get the results you want, it makes solving problems easy. But manipulating can also lead to other problems I feel as well depending on the person. Johnson talks about a “Ripple Effect” that I would like to mention because it makes sense. A software engineer for Snapchat develops a solution that is effective to solve multiple bugs with an update. But when said update is released to the public, users find it difficult to navigate the application now (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Johnson ended his argument with the hardest problems are the most complex linear thinking use effective however, system thinking has the necessary attributes to tackle most challenges (From Linear to Systems Thinking: Solving Complex Tech Challenges, 2024). Efficiency is personally what I appreciate the most when it comes to problem solving. </p>
            <h3>MODEL-BASED APPROACH:</h3>
            <p> Descending, I must ask myself why is a model-based approach applicable to the design of complex systems? Carnegie Mellon University out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will give us more insight into the answer to my question. Model-based approaches in the systems engineering world supports design, analysis, verification, and validation with the development of complex systems (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Model-based approaches are applicable to the development of complex systems due to the effectiveness. Because of software engineering I feel to use this more often with technology when covering a lot of information at one time. A digital modeling environment helps remove inconsistencies within, enforces standards by stakeholders, improves the analysis of systems, reduces defects and adds more windows for design and information (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Making the engineering side of things more manageable when dealing with complexity in a system (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). With the rise of artificial intelligence can and will indefinitely replace software engineering steps that people need to take. I am afraid that this might not be for the greater good if we are not careful. Dissecting what modeling means specifically in technology has four instruments if you will be being, language, structure, argumentation, and presentation (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Language dealing with the idea of the model, language being strict syntax rules, arguments are the relationship between the two, and presentations involve simulations (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). All serving their part when dealing with model-based systems thinking. Comparing to a science project you have your “language” or terminology, “structure” and equations/formulas, “arguments” as a thesis/objective, and “presentation” showing the class your work. Or in the case of the technology space, either an upper-level management person or the entire organization. Finally, the four quadrants model dives deep into linear versus systematic. In layman’s terms, operational logically is the problem description concept, the physical component is the actual problem itself, in tandem with system logical allocating system physicals solution (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). Logical parts change overtime and physical changes are initiated by technological advancements (An Introduction to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), 2020). My final take on model-based approaches when dealing with complex digital systems I find very vast. But overall, the greatest option is when thinking about solutions to said complex digital systems. Due to the parameters that system engineering must live and breathe by. Using this model-based style can help reduce stress and workload when dealing with different difficulties. Especially when working with people in a huge organization with huge projects. </p>

            <h3>Three Life Cycle Models:</h3>
            <p>In abstraction, there are a few life cycle models in MBSE that I will discuss further in the blog. For now, I am touching and going over the concept of life cycle models in its entirety. In the words from Jon Holt in chapter four of Systems Engineering Demystified he talked about how these concepts are associated with ontology heavily (Holt, 2023). Meaning the technological “being” that exists broken into some subcategories (Holt, 2023). Including entities, life cycles, life cycle models, and the stage of said entity that evolves overtime (Holt, 2023). Without an entity all the other parts of the life cycle model will and always be irrelevant in my opinion. Because the evolution of the system/entity determines the stage then that will give you an accurate representation of the life cycle of that system and how far in development it is in (Holt, 2023). I digress on the definition of what a life cycle in MBSE is Holt’s words there are six stages using an SysML block conception, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement (Holt, 2023). Conception is identified with the needs of the system involved in stakeholders’ analysis to prove it (Holt, 2023). Development provides solutions for problems associated with the needs of preferred solutions often using prototypes before the stage of production (Holt, 2023). Production takes solutions and creates it in the system itself requiring various testing and trials to ensure the system is built and verified/validated correctly (Holt, 2023). Utilizations happen when systems are used by stakeholders and end users including the training of the stakeholders to know how to use the system effectively parallelly, with the support stage of next (Holt, 2023). Support entices all services with error, maintenance, and verbatim ensure that the system is running effectively (Holt, 2023). In sequence or not the retirement stage will follow as Holt discussed how and when the system will be disposed of and decommissioned safely and securely (Holt, 2023). Continuation, the fact that the scope of the system plays a role in the actual parameters of the system life cycle I found fascinating further in the chapter. Three different scopes being the project, program, and product life cycles (Holt, 2023). As Holt elaborates further, the Project life cycle is the evolution of a specific project possibly contained in multiples within a single system life cycle linked to projects and programs indefinitely (Holt, 2023). Program life cycles abstractly sit above the life cycle of projects kind of as a folder in your file explorer or a portfolio if you will of programs (Holt, 2023). Product life cycles are what is finalized and sold to stakeholders or customers and not all can be products (Holt, 2023). Because certain systems have different parameters and cannot run without others, buying them individually can lead to miscues with the system. Sometimes relying on each other to perform specific tasks or functions that the customer needs. Funneling into, life cycles cannot be without evolution of entities that is the structure (Holt, 2023). For life cycle models to proceed to proper stages there must be a base like a foundation when building a house. Furthermore, I will discuss in this mindful blog what I think Linear, Iterative, and Incremental life cycles are to me. </p>
            <h3>Linear: </h3>
            <p> Diving into linear systems model without using the words of Holt I would think being a straightforward line model. A step-by-step iteration following a logical form of steps. Holt specifies that the steps are executed in a linear sequence in other words a waterfall model (Holt, 2023). Specifically staged in order a point A to B model with no way of going back to the previous stages. (Holt, 2023). Dominalty used for projects where needs are well depicted and thorough, I compare it as an instruction manual to putting together a dresser (Holt, 2023). Which in fact the steps for an Amazon dresser are nice especially if you only bought it for 50 bucks. I assume that Amazon uses similar linear models or when discussing MBSE with system engineers. Linear models are not suitable for larger projects and longer ones as specified by Holt since the complexity of engineering these systems are vast (Holt, 2023). But you would think the linear model would be most efficient, but I do not deem it so.  </p>
            <h3>Iterative/Incremental:</h3>
            <p>Linyanage wrote in an article published by Medium about the iterative model and how it affects software development. She elaborated on what this model is, meaning a system is developed in small sections or iterations if you will (Liyanage, 2025). Linyanage describes how this model works and makes sense on how she worded it. Iteratively it is cyclical involving planning, designing, implementation, testing, and evaluation and feedback (Liyanage, 2025). The moment an iteration is complete whatever feedback is received will help improve the next cycle (Liyanage, 2025). We as software engineers will repeat this until the cycles are complete leading to the desired results and quality (Liyanage, 2025). Diving deeper into the five ends of iterative models each having its own function in a system. Requirement/planning talks about what is needed for current and future iterations taking place in the starting stage (Liyanage, 2025). Designing initially what the architecture of the system will look like with flexibility for change and new features are implemented incrementally (Liyanage, 2025). When you study for tests the knowledge you obtain is in increments, I like to compare it as that. Implementation, being small parts of software during development are tested reducing in development time frames (Liyanage, 2025). Testing is basic just involves iteration revising during development including bug fixes, errors, improving the overall quality of the system (Liyanage, 2025). Finally, there will be the evaluation portion which is reviewed by iteration via a stakeholder, and this is where feedback will be provided to tend to customer needs and expectations (Liyanage, 2025). Ensuring the customer leaves happy and fully understood with how their product was made and its functionality. </p>
            <p>Transgressing into the Incremental Life cycle models, Geeksforgeeks specifies that this model is used for systems in development in smaller parts that are manageable otherwise incrementally (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Building a system in smaller parts rather than larger parts sometimes less is more the way I see it. Advancing into the phases of incremental model I will touch on this briefly. You have four phases being requirement analysis, design and development, testing, and implementation like the iterative model but not quite according to geeksforgeeks. Requiring that the current increments are identified and gathered and design similar as before where new features are developed (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Testing is rather obvious which is making sure everything is up to code and things work perfectly (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Implementation includes the tested increments that are integrated into previous versions of the system and are delivered, and rinse and repeat these steps until the final system is completed (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Very effective when working with larger/longer projects I feel this would be the best choice. As an example, the gaming software development community especially with how the graphics are now. It takes a lot of technological resources and knowledge to complete down to the last animation. If a character in their video game moves incorrectly then the development team must then go back into the code, find the bug and fix it all together. </p>
            <p>Subcategories in this incremental model include staged delivery and parallel development models each serving a unique purpose in MBSE. Staged delivery involves a sequence of software development in planned stages where each stage serves to the system (geeksforgeeks, 2026). As the system evolves overtime gradually it will lead to a completion of the product needed (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Delivered at normal intervals to make progress of system creation manageable and clear (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Versus the parallel development model kind of divides and conquers the system development in its entirety (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Occasionally branching off but multiple iterations are developed simultaneously by different teams of engineers (geeksforgeeks, 2026). Help reduce the workload I feel and overall product quality and the desired results the stakeholders are looking for. I also would not mind that considering making a system on a larger scale I can only imagine is harder to accomplish alone. But with proper teamwork and coordination the efficiency of that system development will follow suit. All depends on if you have the team that has the necessary skillsets to complete these tasks alone and stay aligned with the end goal of the best product quality. </p>

            <h3>Human-Centered Design:</h3>
               <p>Human-centered design kind of reminds of the stigma behind people of the “one percent”. I am sure you have seen or heard of these types of people on the internet. This type of social media influences people that have everything they have every wanted. Money, power, and mindset, just as we are about to dive into the mindsets of human-centered designers. There are seven that identify who these types of designers are “Empathy, Optimism, Iteration, Creative Confidence, Making, Embracing Ambiguity, and Learning from Failure” (IDEO.org, 2015). I will give you my interpretation on what I think these different mindsets mean. To maintain your creativity, you must have empathy for others, while holding good energy (IDEO.org, 2015). “Empathy, Optimism, and Iteration” go together with subcategories “Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation” (IDEO.org, 2015). Understanding people brings generation of ideas, which will equal to maximization of your solutions (IDEO.org, 2015). I compare it to when you own a business with someone. You are partners so you must understand each other positively, encouraging ideas, creating your effective product. That will eventually impact not only your business but your environment. Creating solutions to complex problems can be difficult and at times uncomfortable. “Diverging and Converging” as you work through the process of problem solving your design, will lead you to tons of trial and error (IDEO.org, 2015). But with a successful solution there must be a form of discipline to reach the end goal. Along while there is a balance between these first three mindsets, for them to make a real impact (IDEO.org, 2015). Start with what is your desired solution, followed by what is viable for business, then what technology finds feasible (IDEO.org, 2015). Moving forward with the creative confidence that you need to generate big ideas later (IDEO.org, 2015). Founder of IDEO “David Kelly” illustrates what creative confidence will produce. “Creative confidence is the belief that anyone is creative, can make leaps, trust their intuition, and chase the solutions” (IDEO.org, 2015). Confidence is the driver to just get things done in general. So, I agree with what Founder “Kelly” has to say about “Creative Confidence” in human-centered design. It does take time however to build creative confidence but it’s all about the small wins (IDEO.org, 2015). When people of the “one percent “make it, they feel on top of the world. CEO of D-Rev “Krista Donaldson” elaborates on how these ties into Human-centered design. Making use of anything at our disposal to build, tinker, and do the best possible ideas for the people we are serving (IDEO.org, 2015). People of the “One Percent” experience failure tenfold. CEO of IDEO “Tim Brown” has something better to say about that. “Fail early to succeed sooner” to “keep learning, testing, and asking” just because you failed does not mean its over. You just found a way that unfortunately did not work out in your favor and have a chance to try again. Co-Lead and Creative Director of IDEO.org “Patrice Martin”, gives us insight on the final mindset of human-centered design. “Embracing Ambiguity”, is understanding that there are other paths for solutions you can take (IDEO.org, 2015). Being open to innovation and allowing the brain to be creative leading to lasting impact in design (IDEO.org, 2015). Leaping off human-centered design in my eyes is all about your mindset when creating.</p>
            <h3>Perspectives Of ISO 9241-210 & IDEO’s Field Guide:</h3>
               <p>Furthermore, the perspectives of ISO 9241-210 compared to the vision of IDEO’s field guide. By the sounds of it to me “IDEO’s Field Guide” provides mindset expansion. While “ISO 9241-210” gives us a more technical approach on human-centered design. Fundamentally the perquisite towards “ISO 9241-210” is as follows: “the system, product, or service design must base around the understanding of the users, tasks, and work environment” (Design, 1999). To provide and develop a solution you must collect feedback regarding solutions (Design, 1999). As further discussed, there are six steps in “ISO 9241-210” when it comes to human-centered design. “Planning the human-centered design process” involves the overall development process (Design, 1999). Basically, defining your roadmap if you will but with a purpose and each leading to the product. Next is to “Understand and specify the Context of Use”, is comparing your context to existing systems or similar ones (Design, 1999). Helping you identify weaknesses and determine what the future of your context will look like (Design, 1999). Examples being what characteristics fall on the users, stakeholders, goals of tasks, and the environment of the system (Design, 1999). Essentially the foundation and behind the scenes of your design. Pivoting towards “Specifying the User Requirements”, is split between users and stakeholders (Design, 1999). Involving different stakeholders leads to catering the user requirements to fit the needs of the stakeholders (Design, 1999). While one team of users may not agree with another, we must find a medium for implementation, ideally free from any contradictions (Design, 1999). Any new idea will bring new problems which ultimately will also lead to new solutions. All for the benefit of the user, stakeholders, and eventually the systems market environment. But how do users produce solutions for their designs? Users work alongside the stakeholders by using iteration showcasing “UI parts, simulations, or prototypes” (Design, 1999). Kind of like when you have a group class presentation as an example. Your project is your prototype and the fellow group members are stakeholders. They all must come to an agreement upon what the final design will look like. Hopefully eliminating all errors and leading you towards an effective final design implementation. One of the final steps of “ISO 9241-210” is “evaluating the design” in preparation for finalization. Evaluation follows this process, “getting new information, understanding strengths and weaknesses, checking user requirements, comparing variants, and benchmarking” (Design, 1999). Ensuring that all the elements of the design are met and fulfilled. In conclusion, “ISO 9241-210” is the showcasing of different representations, or different emphases on a human-centered design (Design, 1999). Like I said earlier comparing the “IDEO” perspective, to “ISO 9241-210” it is the mindset approach versus the technical approach. When “human-centered design” enters the playing field of the system design we can categorize our approach accordingly.</p>
            <h3>Perception And Visual Hierarchy Affects Usability:</h3>
               <p>Transcending into the human visual perception and attention influences the interface usability. Human visual perception varies in a few different factors. Every human being has different perception of how they see something. That is one of the very things that make us human. If we all perceived the same way the world would be a totally different place. Author Jeff Johnson of “Designing with The Mind in Mind” dives into this further. Our brain can “prime” our perception to be especially sensitive to what we are looking for (Johnson, 2010). When we single something out our brain focuses on that specific item. Example being when we are looking for something in the grocery store. The box of cereal that is the only thing left to buy we single it out on the shelf. And our brain ignores everything since we have only that one box of cereal in mind. Without us even realizing it we primarily just focus on what is needed. The way our perception affects us with a system design I feel is quite similar. Oluwatobi Akindunjoye a system designer wrote the article “Visual perception in user experience design”, backing this comparison up. He breaks up human visual perception in three stages “Feature detection, pattern identification, and object recognition” (Akindunjoye, 2019). Feature detection is how the human eye breaks down visual features like “colors, shades, angles, slopes, etc.” (Akindunjoye, 2019). It is a very sudden and quick detection our brain makes when something pops out at us. Pattern identification is how we compose those features into patterns or groups, and he briefly discusses the “Gestalt principle” is the idea we see the whole of something before the individual parts” (Akindunjoye, 2019). Like when we are shopping on Amazon, we see the entire page of items. Before we single out the “purse or speaker” we want to add to our shopping cart. Lastly the combination of the first two stages ultimately leads to “object recognition” (Akindunjoye, 2019). Information that is not immediately visible proves to eventually draw attention, which points how the interface is being used (Akindunjoye, 2019). How I understand it now is the perception of humans entices the focus of attention. Which leads to how the human centers interface usability. If something grabs the attention of the user quickly, or flashes out at them, that then forces the user to use the interface. Absorbing their perception fully because the design is catered to do so.</p>
            <h3>Four UX Laws, With My Analysis:</h3>
               <p>The finale being, “Four UX Laws and the application of design elements”. Starting with “Jakobs’ law”, is all about familiarity, users expect websites to be similarly designed and convenient (Stevens, 2024). Without reinventing the wheel making sure the design is fundamentally grounded and simplistic. ‘Fitts’s Law” considers, how quickly and easily a user can reach a particular target to interact with it (Stevens, 2024). How quickly can you add that new sweatshirt to your shopping cart? “Hick’s Law’ explains, the more options a user is presented with, the more complex the options are, the harder it is to decide (Stevens, 2024). With fewer options the user can make a quicker choice and vice-a-versa. And in the end, we got “Miller’s law” stating, the average person can only hold 7 items in their working memory, plus or minus 2” (Stevens, 2024). The goal here would be to have an organized and clean design to reduce the workload placed on the user. Allowing stress-free system interaction, providing efficient and easy access. The resolution being these four laws are all user-focused, and as system designers we must follow these laws. Because, at the end of the day the user is what makes the product.
