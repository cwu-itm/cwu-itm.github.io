            <h3>Systems Thinking for Digital Environments</h3>
            <p>Holt (2022) defines systems thinking as a way to make clear the relationships, interfaces, and interaction of component systems, instead of seeing them in isolation. In summary, systems thinking is the ability to look at the large system in general rather than at the smaller components in isolation. Focus is on the interplay of each part of the system; the effects of each one on the whole. In modern systems, especially technologically, it is relatively uncommon for a system to be simple. Websites, apps, etc. are multilayered pieces of a bigger whole that must all work collaboratively during that process. As a result, systems thinking has developed in such a manner that the design of digitally-based systems becomes a more robust mechanism, as it is essential that things work seamlessly, simultaneously (Holt, 2022). </p>
            <h3>In my own words</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking to me is like walking away to see how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together before taking a step forward and trying to fix or build something different. Not simply one thing at a time, but the relationship between these things. When a thing is broken down on the basis of components, it means knowing how they depend on each other and how one modification might affect the other components. Holt (2022) emphasizes that systems involve components which continuously influence and respond to one another which are just as important as the system's individual components. It is the combination of the problems: multiple pieces not in unison, not one failure,  that is the cause of a lot of failures. For example, a webpage may look great from the outside and load, but if it can’t handle traffic or connect correctly to a database, the system will break down. Systems thinking works in contrast to the approach of ignoring these relationships in the early stages.</p>
            <h3>Systems vs Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p> Linear thinking considers the task in its own parts, as each part is self-created. It is the integration point at the end of the process when one looks inwards. To illustrate, the first step is to construct a part, then a more or less a third part, then another. Even for easy predictable issues/projects, though, this strategy fails at times with growing complexity. One of the big distinctions between systems thinking and linear thinking is the timing. As noted, integration in linear thinking cannot be emphasized until the majority of components are created. In systems thinking, integration becomes the goal from the start. Without developing the parts, designers only contemplate how components will link together. The focus is another thing that's different; linear thinking focuses on tasks and components, while systems thinking is more closely related to relationships and interactions. A component might work well on its own, but a component without proper interactions can be inefficient and cause failures. Complexity and poor communication, according to Holt (2022), are some of the reasons why systems fail. Linear thinking often aggravates these problems: teams will work on individual parts separately, not fully realizing how their hard work affects the whole system. When everything is built out, remediating problems is more complicated and expensive than ever.</p>
            <h3>Why Linear Thinking in Complex Systems can be an Issue</h3>
            <p>Linear thinking is a thinking problem of the system-as-cause-and-effect type that assumes system behaviour is cause and effect (i.e., system behavior works cause and effect for everything) which does not always occur. The majority of contemporary systems involve feedback loops and a system's behavior evolves over time. Meadows (2008) has observed that complexity can ineluctably result from the unpredictability of systems, as activities in one part can have an adverse effect on the other. It doesn’t take the form of linear thinking because of its disconnected point of view on problems. For example, if a new feature is introduced in an app that would help the user, but may increase server costs or add a security concern too, that’s an example of adding something new but at the same time it will also make your app even more expensive.</p>
            <h3>Model Based Approach</h3>
            <p>Systems are becoming increasingly intricate, and to think system-based is not necessarily the best way. Designers themselves require an understanding to help structure knowledge and to see how it all fits together. This is where model based systems engineering (MBSE) comes in handy (INCOSE, 2022). Holt (2022) adds that this method of model is that the model becomes the main source of information about the system. Everything is structured together in a neat, orderly manner, rather than scattered documents, notes, or diagrams. This is the framework which indicates what the system should be capable of, how it is built and how different components come together; the model provides a general picture of the system. A model is a mapping of the system and it provides designers insights into how everything interconnects prior to the system getting built out so that all is linked between everything else. This helps detect issues sooner and the long-term effects of changes. The thing that is great about this method is there is less confusion. Different teams using different documents can lead to inconsistent information. A feature may be described differently in one file and differently in another. Using a shared model keeps everyone on the same page. That is how models ease complexity for you. For it to be effective, using a model-based method is good for communication. Developers, designers, managers, as well as security teams can reference the same model in the system. When something changes, the model is updated and a consequence of change can be detected throughout the system.</p>
            <h3>Wrapping things up</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking, in the end, is just intentional technology design. It encourages not thinking of each individual element as a task, but thinking of how everything makes contact and how each relationship changes the product. The digital world is built on devices interacting with users, networks, data and other systems. That kind of thinking is far more realistic than a simplistic linear approach. A model-based methodology facilitates this goal because it offers designers a framework for information storage, data analysis, and preparation for change well in advance of challenges themselves (Holt, 2022). As technology moves to this stage, designing systems with a global lens is certainly better for technology but it is also more crucial than ever if systems are to deliver on promises and capabilities out in the wild. What makes this approach so useful is the rapid pace with which digital systems change. They are always adding features, updates and new user expectations. Without systems thinking, such transitions usually come with unforeseen side effects including slowdowns, bugs, security compromises, or compromised integrations. Small decisions can, however, add up if designers fail to consider the broader system-wide effects of updates. Systems thinking is meant to avoid this altogether, to make real the connection between what we think in the short term versus what we think in the long term. A model approach would support that mindset as it would allow designers to see and trace those relationships over time. If team members are not forced to use memory or occasional scraps of fragmented documentation, they can use the model to better know how different parts are connected and where there are risks. And when systems must grow, interface with new technologies or need to adapt to new requirements, understanding this needs to be more emphasized. Rather than rebuilding from scratch or throwing away an issue as soon as it arrives, a designer can adopt a design tweak that leaves room for stability. Systems thinking takes into account reliability, clarity, and long-term success, not just speed or convenience. In digital systems  that are all interlocking, ignoring the fundamentals is almost as bad as the next problem. Systems thinking, facilitated through the model-based approach which allows for the design of technologies that work not just after launch, but over time as developed and normalized by others into their everyday lives.</p>
