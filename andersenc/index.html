            <h3>Systems Thinking for Digital Environments</h3>
            <p>Holt (2022) defines systems thinking as a way to make clear the relationships, interfaces, and interaction of component systems, instead of seeing them in isolation. In summary, systems thinking is the ability to look at the large system in general rather than at the smaller components in isolation. Focus is on the interplay of each part of the system; the effects of each one on the whole. In modern systems, especially technologically, it is relatively uncommon for a system to be simple. Websites, apps, etc. are multilayered pieces of a bigger whole that must all work collaboratively during that process. As a result, systems thinking has developed in such a manner that the design of digitally-based systems becomes a more robust mechanism, as it is essential that things work seamlessly, simultaneously (Holt, 2022). </p>
            <h3>In my own words</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking to me is like walking away to see how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together before taking a step forward and trying to fix or build something different. Not simply one thing at a time, but the relationship between these things. When a thing is broken down on the basis of components, it means knowing how they depend on each other and how one modification might affect the other components. Holt (2022) emphasizes that systems involve components which continuously influence and respond to one another which are just as important as the system's individual components. It is the combination of the problems: multiple pieces not in unison, not one failure,  that is the cause of a lot of failures. For example, a webpage may look great from the outside and load, but if it can’t handle traffic or connect correctly to a database, the system will break down. Systems thinking works in contrast to the approach of ignoring these relationships in the early stages.</p>
            <h3>Systems vs Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p> Linear thinking considers the task in its own parts, as each part is self-created. It is the integration point at the end of the process when one looks inwards. To illustrate, the first step is to construct a part, then a more or less a third part, then another. Even for easy predictable issues/projects, though, this strategy fails at times with growing complexity. One of the big distinctions between systems thinking and linear thinking is the timing. As noted, integration in linear thinking cannot be emphasized until the majority of components are created. In systems thinking, integration becomes the goal from the start. Without developing the parts, designers only contemplate how components will link together. The focus is another thing that's different; linear thinking focuses on tasks and components, while systems thinking is more closely related to relationships and interactions. A component might work well on its own, but a component without proper interactions can be inefficient and cause failures. Complexity and poor communication, according to Holt (2022), are some of the reasons why systems fail. Linear thinking often aggravates these problems: teams will work on individual parts separately, not fully realizing how their hard work affects the whole system. When everything is built out, remediating problems is more complicated and expensive than ever.</p>
            <h3>Why Linear Thinking in Complex Systems can be an Issue</h3>
            <p>Linear thinking is a thinking problem of the system-as-cause-and-effect type that assumes system behaviour is cause and effect (i.e., system behavior works cause and effect for everything) which does not always occur. The majority of contemporary systems involve feedback loops and a system's behavior evolves over time. Meadows (2008) has observed that complexity can ineluctably result from the unpredictability of systems, as activities in one part can have an adverse effect on the other. It doesn’t take the form of linear thinking because of its disconnected point of view on problems. For example, if a new feature is introduced in an app that would help the user, but may increase server costs or add a security concern too, that’s an example of adding something new but at the same time it will also make your app even more expensive.</p>
            <h3>Model Based Approach</h3>
            <p>Systems are becoming increasingly intricate, and to think system-based is not necessarily the best way. Designers themselves require an understanding to help structure knowledge and to see how it all fits together. This is where model based systems engineering (MBSE) comes in handy (INCOSE, 2022). Holt (2022) adds that this method of model is that the model becomes the main source of information about the system. Everything is structured together in a neat, orderly manner, rather than scattered documents, notes, or diagrams. This is the framework which indicates what the system should be capable of, how it is built and how different components come together; the model provides a general picture of the system. A model is a mapping of the system and it provides designers insights into how everything interconnects prior to the system getting built out so that all is linked between everything else. This helps detect issues sooner and the long-term effects of changes. The thing that is great about this method is there is less confusion. Different teams using different documents can lead to inconsistent information. A feature may be described differently in one file and differently in another. Using a shared model keeps everyone on the same page. That is how models ease complexity for you. For it to be effective, using a model-based method is good for communication. Developers, designers, managers, as well as security teams can reference the same model in the system. When something changes, the model is updated and a consequence of change can be detected throughout the system.</p>
            <h3>Wrapping things up</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking, in the end, is just intentional technology design. It encourages not thinking of each individual element as a task, but thinking of how everything makes contact and how each relationship changes the product. The digital world is built on devices interacting with users, networks, data and other systems. That kind of thinking is far more realistic than a simplistic linear approach. A model-based methodology facilitates this goal because it offers designers a framework for information storage, data analysis, and preparation for change well in advance of challenges themselves (Holt, 2022). As technology moves to this stage, designing systems with a global lens is certainly better for technology but it is also more crucial than ever if systems are to deliver on promises and capabilities out in the wild. What makes this approach so useful is the rapid pace with which digital systems change. They are always adding features, updates and new user expectations. Without systems thinking, such transitions usually come with unforeseen side effects including slowdowns, bugs, security compromises, or compromised integrations. Small decisions can, however, add up if designers fail to consider the broader system-wide effects of updates. Systems thinking is meant to avoid this altogether, to make real the connection between what we think in the short term versus what we think in the long term. A model approach would support that mindset as it would allow designers to see and trace those relationships over time. If team members are not forced to use memory or occasional scraps of fragmented documentation, they can use the model to better know how different parts are connected and where there are risks. And when systems must grow, interface with new technologies or need to adapt to new requirements, understanding this needs to be more emphasized. Rather than rebuilding from scratch or throwing away an issue as soon as it arrives, a designer can adopt a design tweak that leaves room for stability. Systems thinking takes into account reliability, clarity, and long-term success, not just speed or convenience. In digital systems  that are all interlocking, ignoring the fundamentals is almost as bad as the next problem. Systems thinking, facilitated through the model-based approach which allows for the design of technologies that work not just after launch, but over time as developed and normalized by others into their everyday lives.</p>

  <h3>Systems Life Cycle Models in Digital Environments</h3>

  <p>
    When thinking about technology, people’s minds are usually filled with the thought of the end product. This could be an app, a website, a system, etc., but typically it is something that will already work. What some people forget to think about is everything that happens either before or after the system’s rollout. Your digital systems don’t get constructed once and never evolve. They have a process that includes processes all the way from starting up all the way up to the completion of the life cycle of the system. Understanding what life cycle is, then, also matters because it describes how systems are designed, built and maintained, all the way to ultimately being replaced or altered.
  </p>

  <p>
    This process is then divided up under a life-cycle model of systems engineering. It gives the team a way to see what stage a system is at, what it should be as it moves further. Holt (2022) clarifies that life cycle thinking encourages designers to not only target what exactly is the system, but how such a system should be maintained and revised. Especially in the digital world where technology never stays fairly static and user needs always keep going up.
  </p>

  <p>
    At a glance, the systems life cycle is a sequence of stages including problem identification, problem solving, design, building, validation, deployment, and support of the system. At some point systems become old and need to be replaced. A good strategy that will prevent jumping to conclusions or designing poorly is considering every one of these phases in-depth on a pre-programmatic timeline. Rather than reacting to issues in the moment, teams can prepare for issues as they surface.
  </p>

  <h3>Linear Life Cycle Model</h3>

  <p>
    One of the more conventional approaches to the life cycle is a linear model. All is step by step to the end of the life cycle. Requirements are gathered in the very first place. That is how it is, the system is designed, built, tested, and deployed. Teams rarely go back and modify a stage after the point where the stage has ended, and usually once they have.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach tends to work really well for small projects like these--or systems where requirements are established from the beginning. But linear models are seldom viable for the present digital systems we use. In fact, the technology changes so fast, something is very, very unlikely to hold once a project has been established as a whole. The late-in-development problem can be painful, expensive. This inflexibility can allow outdated or inefficient systems to become outdated soon on opening in the market (Holt, 2022).
  </p>

  <h3>Iterative Life Cycle Model</h3>

  <p>
    The majority of teams, therefore, follow iterative life cycle models. Systems are built in cycles in repeating iterations. Rather than taking everything to build at once, teams develop, build, test and iterate smaller parts of the system over weeks (or a year). All design iterations are tested, developed, and validated with the help of feedback, experimentation or insight from feedback, testing, or new data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Should a given feature be requested or a bug be cited by users, the group can do the work and fix the software in the next iteration. It also involves good communication and organization, even though it is far more flexible. Consistent change and variation (if goals are not clear) could bog down the project or make them unclear.
  </p>

  <h3>Incremental Life Cycle Model</h3>

  <p>
    An approach that was widely considered, however, is the incremental life cycle approach. The approach to incremental development is trying to do smaller chunks of a system where it will end up being usable, in smaller parts, little by little. Teams release system components in small doses rather than tearing it out of a box and waiting for everything to be finalized. Provide additional functionality wherever you can, providing additional functionality up until full system completion.
  </p>

  <p>
    This works for users, If they get the system sooner it works better, and developers are continually tweaking the product. Incremental models of growth are particularly useful in digital contexts where systems need to incrementally progress over time. And an app might develop modest features at launch, then incrementally add new features to it as development becomes faster, especially through updates.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Holt (2022) has written, doing this lowers risk because it is easier to resolve issues by using just one increment, without compromising the overall system. And systems thinking is favored because every subsequent piece has to mesh well with what’s already in place.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Life Cycle Models Matter</h3>

  <p>
    There aren’t some right model of life cycle for all cases. Linear models do provide a shape, but they are inflexible. Innovative, iterative models call for strong coordination: Learnable and adaptable. Incremental approaches are at the middleground between progress and adaptation but require planning in details. In practice and in many real-life projects, teams leverage parts of several models to suit their individual needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Life cycle models are important in the case of digital systems, because these systems are rarely stable. Websites and apps are not static, and need upgrades and security patches and performance improvements and new features. They could bring unexpected problems to bear because there is no clear life cycle plan for each update.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feedback loops and components operating in a different way tend to produce unpredictable behavior in systems (Meadows, 2008). A small adjustment in one area starts troubles in another. Inventing the life cycle reduces these kinds of team issues through long-term thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Designers do not only look forward to the quick-fixes, instead, they consider how such changes may have an impact on the system in the longer term. This leads to better, resilient systems. It is also a cost reduction: systems that were easier to maintain in the past are inherently less likely to depend on a flood of emergency remedies later in the year.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE), to design systems prepared for the future, there has to be life cycle consciousness (INCOSE, 2018). Failures will quickly proliferate as digital systems grow more interconnected. Careful, deliberately-built life cycle plans teams assist by a carefully executed life cycle plans help them through this diversity, getting prepared rather than getting caught in the net-jumps before or after that happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    In preparation, they are ready to get ready for change yet are not overwhelmed by it. Life cycle models dictate how users experience systems in everyday technology that they are in touch with every day. The concept of the incremental and iterative life cycle is also being used with regular updates, new functions, and improvements. In other words, its application in everyday business processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    When they’re fine-tuned, and these processes are the go-to, systems are good, seem smooth and reliable. When they aren’t, users get bugs, crashes or broken features.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last but not least, systems life cycle models advocate for planning of technology that is intentional in nature. They can offer designers a reminder that building a system is not about having it work at a single moment, but over time. Digital systems function in a dynamic and fluid environment, so failing to realize this fact virtually guarantees future issues.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implementing a life cycle and systems thinking when designing solutions also facilitates design systems that are more adaptable, more reliable, of which the first is a good example. At a time when the world of technology and its applications is evolving at such a fast pace, life cycle thinking is more than helpful, it is necessary for a system to succeed practically speaking.
