            <h3>introduction</h3>
            <p>The type of digital systems used today are more complex and interconnected than ever, which can also make them unpredictable. These types of systems include cloud platforms, websites, and other applications. These types of systems have many moving parts, which is where most problems come from. Due to a digital system having many different moving parts, it can be difficult to find where a potential problem is coming from. That is where system thinking becomes a useful skill. Rather than just looking at singular events, it encourages us to think about how each component of a particular system affects the other parts.</p>
            <p>
        This blog post will explain what system thinking is, how it differs from other approaches such as traditional linear thinking, and the benefits of doing so. By better understanding these concepts, we are more equipped to handle complex systems and use the best approach when dealing with specific digital systems.
    </p>
 <h3>System Thinking</h3>
    <p>
        As previously stated, system thinking is a holistic approach to understanding how a system functions (JWU, 2025). Although systems can be anything—including natural systems—in this case they are mostly digital systems. But system thinking does not only help people understand digital systems; doctors can view the human body as a system, construction workers can view a house as a system, and a father can view their family as a system. It applies to many different concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        You cannot talk about system thinking without first acknowledging system engineering. In today’s digital landscape, new systems are being engineered constantly. This is the act of creating a new system. Another aspect of systems is that they often have stakeholders—individuals who rely on the system to be successful or have an interest in it. Another attribute of a system is that they can often be complicated; some aspects of the human body remain a complete mystery even in today’s age. This means that small changes in the system can have effects that lead to big outcomes. If we examine those small changes beforehand using system thinking, we can be more prepared to anticipate and understand the outcome. This can be a lot more useful than linear thinking, which just treats the problems as they arise. In today’s digital landscape, it is especially important for IT professionals to approach these platforms with system thinking.
    </p>

    <h3>Linear Thinking</h3>
    <p>
        To show why system thinking is a better approach, we will compare it to its counterpart: linear thinking. This is the traditional approach when it comes to solving problems in a system. This process typically involves finding a problem and then addressing the problem but not the root of it. For example, let’s say my computer keeps crashing every time I try and play a video game. A linear approach would be a more obvious, surface-level solution. Maybe I assume the game is too demanding, so I lower the graphic settings. Now say it still is not working—I could assume that my computer just isn’t powerful enough and I need to upgrade it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The issue with approaching the problem like this is that I am only reacting to the crash without understanding why it could occur. Instead of looking at the system as containing individual parts, I should view my computer as a system with multiple parts, with each part affecting the other. A system thinking approach would be more useful, such as asking: Is the GPU overheating because the fans are clogged? Is the power supply not enough? Is the game interacting poorly with a certain application that is open? Although it can be a bit overwhelming, by looking at the computer as a system, I am more likely to find the cause of the problem. In IT careers, it is essential to not only fix problems as they occur but understand and then fix the underlying issues.
    </p>

    <h3>MDSE</h3>
    <p>
        In more complex digital systems, it can be harder to understand them. That is where Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) comes in handy. MBSE uses diagrams, models, and structures to show how a system works (IBM, 2023). Think of it like blueprints for a house or schematics for a highway. This can help you mentally track how all the parts connect when it is all laid out. This helps everyone involved with the system avoid confusion. It can also help avoid problems early by noticing them before the system is implemented. Let’s say we are designing a laptop and are deciding what needs to go where. After it is completed, you notice that the location you planned to put the GPU in will overheat more easily than another area. This allows you to address the root cause of something before it becomes a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        A great aspect of MBSE is that it directly aligns with system thinking. It encourages people to look at relationships and interactions between different parts of a system. When you can see how a system is meant to operate, you can anticipate potential issues that could arise. The best-made systems are ones that are made in this way, so most problems can be ironed out before they are implemented or released. This is a huge problem in the video game industry. Far too often, games are released and then plagued by performance issues and bugs. I believe that if some studios were to implement MBSE and systems thinking when designing their game, they would be higher quality and less likely to contain glitches or bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
        For cloud environments, diagrams can be helpful to show how the data is retrieved and stored, and how it can be scaled. These models make it easier to troubleshoot issues, plan for growth, and make sure systems behave as they are intended to. Model-based approaches use system thinking to create something tangible that helps us understand and design systems that function as they should.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        As previously stated, the word “system” covers many things: a pond, a web application, a human body, or countless others. When dealing with a system, it is important to approach it using a holistic system thinking approach. Modern systems are full of moving parts and interactions that are not always obvious to the eye. It is important to step back and understand how everything connects to solve problems, not just the symptoms. That is what system thinking can do, while singular thinking cannot. System thinking gives us a way to understand technology better but can apply to any system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Model-based approaches continue this mindset by giving us tools to visualize and map out complex systems, like blueprints for a house. Whether it maps out the flow of data or how certain aspects are dependent on each other, these models help us make better decisions and understand the systems better. If we see changing one aspect of a system affecting another, we know what to anticipate. As digital environments continue to grow and become more complex, using model-based and system thinking becomes essential to maintaining these systems. Ultimately, MBSE uses system thinking and creates something practical and usable. Considering every aspect of a system can be overwhelming, so using these frameworks can help people better manage systems.

  <h2>Module 1.2 Post</h2>
  <h3>Nick Gav</h3>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The word <em>system</em> covers many types of things throughout the natural and digital world.
    As a system becomes more complex, subsystems contain more and more concepts. This can make
    digital systems especially hard to understand and maintain. For that reason, it is important
    to look at the system development life cycle (SDLC). This is a structured guide on how a
    digital system is created, maintained, and eventually retired. This includes designing,
    building, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This is essentially the life story of a
    particular system. When you examine a digital system with the life cycle in mind, you realize
    that they are evolving and do not stay the same. Digital systems change as they are faced with
    new factors like security threats, new technologies, or any number of other factors. It is
    important for digital systems to keep evolving in order to remain useful and relevant. Without
    a life cycle approach, digital systems could become outdated and impractical. There are three
    different life cycle models: linear, iterative, and incremental. These are all different models
    with different usefulness depending on the situation (Holt, 2021). In this post I will describe
    the SDLC and compare the three major life cycle models, as well as discuss why life cycle
    thinking is essential for building digital systems that will last.
  </p>

  <p>
    The SDLC is a framework that is used to track the phases that a system goes through during its
    lifetime. For example, if a company is developing new software, they use the SDLC as a way to
    plan the requirements necessary to design, build, implement, and maintain it. It serves as a
    roadmap that is shared between different teams working on the same software. This helps ensure
    that the process goes smoothly, instead of the development being unpredictable (Holt, 2021).
  </p>

  <h3>Linear Model</h3>
  <p>
    The first model I will discuss is the linear model, also known as the Waterfall model. This
    model is considered to be one of the oldest ways that software or other digital systems are
    developed. You complete one step before moving on to the next phase. This typically starts
    with understanding the requirements of the system. This step involves establishing what the
    intended software is meant to achieve. Is it a new and improved VPN? Whatever it may be,
    mapping how the software needs to work specifically is key. Once the requirements are
    established, the next step is the design phase. For software development, there are two levels
    of design: high and low level. Higher-level design involves the architecture of the digital
    system, while lower-level design involves logical decisions (GeeksforGeeks, 2023).
  </p>

  <p>
    After that is the development phase, where the team works on creating the digital system. Once
    it is developed, the system enters the testing phase. This is to ensure the software works
    correctly and meets the requirements. Once the software is shown to meet the requirements set
    for it, it is deployed. This means people can now use the company’s VPN. While the system
    remains active, it must be maintained. This means fixing errors from release and others that
    may arise (GeeksforGeeks, 2023).
  </p>

  <p>
    An advantage of the linear model is that it is easy for a team to grasp. Since it follows a
    predictable path, you can ensure that development is straightforward. Since each phase is
    clear, all team members know exactly what their goals are. This type of model is often best
    suited for smaller-scale projects. The downside is that the development cycle lacks
    flexibility. If, for instance, our VPN requirements change, this model would have a hard time
    adapting depending on which phase the team was currently in. With software especially,
    problems can often reveal themselves late. As Sommerville (2016) points out, this can lead to
    increased costs due to rework and delayed delivery. This is especially important in the digital
    world, as it is fast-moving and ever-changing.
  </p>

  <h3>Iterative Model</h3>
  <p>
    The next model we will discuss is the iterative model. This is a different approach where,
    rather than building the entire system at once, it is built in cycles. Each iteration creates a
    working version of the software which can be tested, examined, and refined. This process also
    involves planning the requirements, design and architecture, and development/implementation
    (Talreja, 2023). Let’s say the first attempt at a company’s VPN makes the customers’ computers
    slow by using too much RAM. The team will look at what worked and what didn’t, and continue to
    make improvements. Then the company would release their VPN 2.0.
  </p>

  <p>
    The advantage of this model is that since requirements can often change or be uncertain, this
    allows the team to evolve the digital system to meet those requirements. Since each iteration
    is a working system, teams can find issues early and make changes before too much work is
    already done. This can help reduce risk and allow the team to continue to innovate. Although
    flexibility can be seen as an advantage, it can also be a drawback regarding digital systems.
    It lacks the strong focus of the linear model, meaning that it may not align with intended
    requirements or stakeholder expectations. However, this type of model would be great in
    creating complex software, like our VPN (Talreja, 2023).
  </p>

  <h3>Incremental Model</h3>
  <p>
    The incremental model breaks the project down into smaller, more manageable pieces referred to
    as increments. Each of these increments adds new functions to the existing system. The
    advantage of this model is that users don’t have to wait for the entire system to be finished.
    For example, our VPN is now available for those in Brazil. It is not yet ready for the rest of
    the world, but piece by piece we can work closer to our goal. The downside of this approach is
    that integration of new increments can be tricky. If we add our coverage of Mexico to our
    coverage with Brazil, will there be any unforeseen problems? This approach would fit best in a
    large company with many moving parts (Sommerville, 2016).
  </p>

  <h3>Life Cycle Mindset</h3>
  <p>
    Understanding system development life cycle models is important, but it’s also beneficial to
    think with a life cycle mindset. It is important to understand that all systems, natural and
    digital, are not static. They grow, evolve, and face extinction if not properly maintained. For
    digital systems, this thinking is essential for teams to be able to create systems that are
    sustainable and adaptable (Holt, 2021).
  </p>

  <p>
    The first reason life cycle thinking is important is that it forces a team to think beyond the
    initial build. Complexity often comes from interactions, not from individual components. By
    considering the full life cycle, teams can design systems that are easier to manage (Holt,
    2021). Systems also have the habit of degrading over time. If we leave our VPN without proper
    maintenance and updates, it will begin to fail. By developing our VPN with life cycle
    principles, our systems will be more resilient and successful because we can anticipate change
    rather than be purely reactive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another aspect of digital systems is that they constantly need to evolve. Iterative and
    incremental models both support this because they allow continuous improvement and adaptation
    as requirements and environments change (Sommerville, 2016; Talreja, 2023).
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The system development life cycle should be more than just a development plan; it should be a
    way of thinking about how digital systems grow and change. The linear model offers a
    straightforward structure, the iterative model offers continuous improvement, and the
    incremental model gives users early access to features. None of these models are perfect, and
    the choice depends on the type of digital system and the context in which it is being
    developed. Most importantly, thinking in life cycle terms ensures that digital systems are
    designed to adapt to the changing technology landscape and remain useful over time (Holt,
    2021; Sommerville, 2016).

    <title>Designing for People</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Designing for people begins with a simple idea, if we want someone to use a product, we must understand how they think, see, and feel. Human centered design is built on this belief as it recognizes that people do not behave like machines. They get distracted, rely on habits, and make quick judgments based on what they see first. With this in mind, we can create experiences that feel intuitive rather than frustrating.</p>

<p>Both ISO 9241 210 and IDEO’s Field Guide describe what it means to design for people, but they approach it differently. ISO 9241 210 focuses on structure. It lays out a clear process that starts with understanding the context of use, identifying user requirements, creating solutions, and testing them with real users (ISO, 2019). It treats human centered design as a repeatable method.</p>

<p>IDEO’s Field Guide takes a different and more creative approach. It emphasizes the importance of empathy, optimism, and other emotions. IDEO encourages designers to immerse themselves in people’s lives such as observing their challenges. They will also build prototypes early so they can quickly learn (IDEO, 2015). To keep it simple, ISO creates a roadmap, while IDEO gives the mindset to explore.</p>

<p>Together, these perspectives show that good design requires both discipline and empathy. To design successfully you need structure to stay grounded, but you also need curiosity and openness to understand what people need.</p>

<p>People do not process screens evenly. Visual cues often decide what matters to them. This is why visual hierarchy is important. If the most important action on a page is small or buried, users will miss it. If everything looks equally important, nothing stands out.</p>

<p>For example, placing a primary button in a bold color and giving it stand out to the eye. This aligns with Jakob’s Law, which states that users expect your interface to work like the ones they already know (Nielsen Norman Group, 2020). This goes to show, when you follow familiar patterns, people do not have to think as hard.</p>

<p>Hick’s Law also plays a role. It states that the time it takes to decide increases with the number of choices (Hick, 1952). A cluttered menu or dashboard can overwhelm the eye. Therefore, reducing options or putting them into categories helps people focus on what matters.</p>

<p>As well all know, human attention is limited. People are easily distracted and cannot hold much information in their working memory. A good explanation of this is Miller’s Law. Most people can only remember about seven items at a time or often fewer (Miller, 1956). This is why long forms, complicated navigation, or unclear steps can confuse users.</p>

<p>Breaking tasks into smaller chunks, showing progress indicators, and keeping instructions simple all help reduce this memory problem. When we design with human attention span in mind, we can make it easier for people to stay on track.</p>

<p>Another relevant law is Fitt’s Law. It states that the time it takes to reach a target depends on its size and distance (Fitts, 1954). For example, a small button on the corner of a mobile screen is inconvenient and a barrier. That is why it is important for interactive elements to be large enough to be easily seen and interacted with. With this in mind, the designer is showing respect for the physical context of the user.</p>

<p>That is why empathy is so important. IDEO emphasizes that designers must understand people’s lives, emotions, and environments to create meaningful solutions (IDEO, 2015). ISO echoes this by requiring designers to understand the context of use, including user goals, tasks, and environments (ISO, 2019). Empathy also helps designers avoid assumptions. For example, a visually complex interface may look impressive to a designer, but to a user with low vision or cognitive fatigue, it becomes an issue. A nurse using a tablet during a busy shift needs large buttons, clear labels, and minimal steps. A student using a learning platform on a slow connection needs simple pages that load quickly. These types of decisions come from empathy.</p>

<p>Norman reinforces this idea by arguing that good design must account for real human behavior, not idealized behavior (Norman, 2013). When we design with empathy, we create products that feel supportive rather than demanding.</p>

<p>Designing for people means recognizing that human beings are not perfect and have limits. They often scan instead of reading, or they get overwhelmed by too many choices, and forget things very quickly. People also rely on familiar structure and patterns and can appreciate when a product feels like it what built with them in mind.</p>

<p>ISO 9241 210 gives us a structured process to follow. IDEO’s Field Guide gives us the mindset to explore and empathize. The four UX laws remind us to design for perception, attention, and human behavior. When we combine these ideas, we create experiences that feel intuitive, respectful, and genuinely helpful. That is the best way to design for people.</p>

<h1>What Makes Digital Systems Usable</h1>


<img src="dashboard-clutter-1.jpg" alt="Cluttered dashboard interface example">



<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The usability of a digital system depends on how well it aligns with the way people think, remember, and make decisions. 
    Usability isn’t just about clean layouts or intuitive buttons. It is also about how efficiently the system guides the user 
    through habits and mental shortcuts. Every digital interaction—from checking your email to buying items on Amazon—relies 
    on our memory and the cognitive load that it carries. For the user to have the best experience, the designer needs to keep 
    the user in mind. When designers ignore these factors, it can lead to users feeling frustrated, overwhelmed, or even lost. 
    The best systems feel effortless for users to navigate.
</p>

<p>
    This blog post will show how memory and mental models influence interactions, why feedback is important, and how poor design 
    creates unnecessary cognitive load. To put it simply, usability is about aligning technology with the human mind.
</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>
    As I know more than anyone, human memory is limited and often depends on context. It is easier for people to rely on 
    recognition rather than remembering. We also develop mental models to simplify more complex systems. When a digital 
    interface aligns with these models, it creates a platform that feels intuitive and easy to use.
</p>

<h3>Memory Limits</h3>
<p>
    Our working memory can only hold so much information at one time. For this reason, it is important that interfaces minimize 
    the need for users to remember instructions or complex sequences. Recognition is easier than recall, which is why labels, 
    icons, and familiar layouts matter. They help reduce the cognitive load on the user (Johnson, 2020).
</p>

<p>
    Let’s look at an example. Imagine a website that hides its essential navigation behind unfamiliar icons or in an unfamiliar 
    layout. Returning users would have to remember how to navigate the site, making the visit feel like a chore. I experienced 
    this when navigating Microsoft Access. While some people may use it well after practice, there is a steep learning curve. 
    I constantly had to recall what each button did, which increased my cognitive load.
</p>

<h3>Mental Models</h3>
<p>
    People expect digital systems to behave like past experiences. If someone opens their email, they expect the inbox to be on 
    the left and the compose window on the right. If a new email platform reversed these, users would likely feel frustrated.
</p>

<p>
    For example, when I used an Android phone, the web browser search bar was at the top of the screen. When I switched to an 
    iPhone, the search bar was at the bottom. This adjustment was frustrating—even though it wasn’t poor design—because it 
    violated my mental model.
</p>

<p>
    Visible cues also matter. Users form mental models based on past experiences, not how a digital system actually operates 
    (Norman, 2013). A remove button is often a red “X,” and a save button is still a floppy disk icon. These cues guide users 
    intuitively through digital environments.
</p>

<h2>Usability Principles</h2>
<p>
    Two of the most crucial usability principles are consistency and feedback. These support memory and mental models. When a 
    system is predictable, users are much more likely to navigate it with ease.
</p>

<p>
    Consistency allows users to transfer knowledge from one part of a system to another. This means people do not have to learn 
    new patterns and can free up cognitive resources for real tasks (Johnson, 2020).
</p>

<p>Some examples of important interface consistencies include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Layout</li>
    <li>Iconography</li>
    <li>Navigation design</li>
    <li>Interactive patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When a system is consistent with these, users can decrease their cognitive load and focus on more important tasks.
</p>

<img src="meta_tag_analyzer_tool.jpeg" alt="Meta tag analyzer tool interface example">


<p><strong>[Image 2 Placeholder: Example of inconsistent UI — add attribution here]</strong></p>

<p>
    I experienced an inconsistent system when ordering a t-shirt from a new site. The navigation was different from what I had 
    seen before, and it took time to figure out. I ended up not making the purchase, but had it been easier to navigate, I 
    likely would have bought the shirt.
</p>

<h3>System Feedback</h3>
<p>
    System feedback tells the user what the system is doing, what actions occurred, and whether issues exist. Without feedback, 
    users may not know if they completed their goals successfully or may repeat actions unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
    Norman (2013) explains that feedback is essential for bridging the “gulf of evaluation,” which is the gap between what users 
    expect and what the system communicates. Good feedback is clear, concise, and timely.
</p>

<p>
    For example, when I upload a file to Canvas, a progress bar appears followed by a confirmation message. If the upload fails, 
    Canvas notifies me. Without this feedback, I would be frustrated and unsure whether my work was submitted.
</p>

<h2>Poor Design</h2>
<p>
    Cognitive load increases when systems force users to think more than necessary. Too much information can overwhelm users. 
    This includes interfaces that are cluttered, inconsistent, or misaligned with mental models.
</p>

<p>Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Overloaded Dashboards:</strong>  
        Canvas shows only relevant classes in the navigation menu. Showing all past classes would overwhelm users and violate 
        the principle of progressive disclosure.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Unclear Navigation and Hidden Controls:</strong>  
        Hover-only menus require users to remember where controls are located. This increases cognitive load and confuses new users.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Conflicting Patterns:</strong>  
        If buttons behave differently across screens, users struggle to form a consistent mental model, slowing down their experience.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tesler’s Law</h2>
<p>
    Tesler’s Law states that every system has a certain amount of complexity, which must be balanced between the user and the 
    system (Tesler, 1984). Good design shifts complexity away from the user.
</p>

<p>
    Examples include auto-fill forms, predictive text, and smart suggestions. When designers push complexity onto users, 
    usability decreases. For instance, when I enter personal information in Microsoft Edge, it autofills the fields for me, 
    reducing tedious tasks and improving my experience.
</p>

<h2>Principles from <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em></h2>

<h3>Cognitive Load</h3>
<p>
    Cognitive load refers to how much mental effort a system requires. Johnson (2020) emphasizes minimizing unnecessary mental 
    effort by reducing steps, simplifying choices, using familiar patterns, and ensuring intuitive controls.
</p>

<h3>Perceptual Organization</h3>
<p>
    Humans naturally group related items together. Interfaces that follow this principle help users process information more 
    effectively. When grouping is inconsistent, confusion and frustration follow.
</p>

<p>
    For example, placing a delete button next to an insert button can lead to unintended actions.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Usability is not just about aesthetics—it’s about aligning systems with the way people think. When designers respect memory, 
    mental models, and habits, they create intuitive systems that reduce cognitive load and improve user experience.
