            <h3>Systems Thinking and Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>Technology, and its evolution, have caused them to no longer be perceived as neat pieces that easily fit together. They have become dynamic, constantly changing systems that all work in tandem from interactions of external influence like people, code, businesses, platforms, and so much more. To adapt to this ever-changing landscape of digital environments, there must be a mindset and looks further than just the individual pieces of the puzzle, this is where Systems Thinking comes into play, it allows us to see deeper into the connections, patterns, and structure within these environments. This perspective aligns with engineering principles and prioritizes system structure, boundaries, and interactions, rather than just isolating elements (Holt, 2022).</p>
            <p>This post will go into detail about what Systems Thinking means from my own perspective. I will also compare it to linear thinking, and how it differentiates from systems thinking and how systems thinking is better. I will also touch of the subject of using model-based approaches to apply this type of thinking to digital systems.</p>
            <h3>What is Systems Thinking?</h3>
            <p>To myself, Systems Thinking involves looking at instances through a lens of connectivity. Thinking about how parts worked together to create a phenomenon, rather than focusing on one individual portion. Rather than asking “What single piece caused this issue?” systems thinking turns the perspective into </p>
            <p>This mindset comes from the insight that most instances – especially when it comes to complex systems and software ecosystems – are not caused by one individual issue, rather a multitude of different things collaborating to create the result. To give an example, if a glitch or bug shows up in an application, it might not be as simple as a singular line of code. It could very well rather be a plethora of issues, ranging from architecture decisions, constraints in multiple areas, and more.</p>
            <p>Those who use Systems Thinking map out these patterns, keeping a focus on the structure and behavior, rather than just relying on snapshots. This mindset is surrounded by understanding systems and their behavior involves identifying relationships, both linear and non-linear, delays, properties, elements that linear thinking usually overlooks.</p>
            <h3>How Does System Thinking differ from Linear Thinking?</h3>
            <p>When it comes to linear thinking, problems are usually broken down into individual pieces, isolate issues, and use simple cause-to-effect reasoning to fix problems. This works with issues that involve mechanical portions, controlled environments and more. Mostly where events are easily predictable and the rules governing them are simple.</p>
            <p>Digital systems, however, are never that simple. They constantly grow in complexity and adapt to the environment they are exposed to. The smallest of changes can end up causing a ripple effect through the rest of the system, especially towards the connections that are directly affected by that change, which leads to side effects that are difficult to foresee (Meadows, 2008). FI something changes about a website, it can affect engagement metrics, which can create a domino effect that could affect countless other things.</p>
            <p>In Laws of UX, Yablonski enforces that digital systems need to consider psychological principles – how people will see, interact, and interpret with their interfaces – and that these behaviors have just as much influence on the behavior of systems as technical constraints and more (Yablonski, 2025). This is a representation of a systems perspective, design decisions have the power to create ripple effects through expectations, long-term habits from users, and expectations.</p>
            <p>To contrast, linear thinking could be revamping a websites design and not taking any indication into how it could affect the user base for that website. Decisions, and the mindsets behind them, can cause unforeseen issues with a system, and its performance.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics of Systems Thinking</h3>

<!--INSTRUCTOR COMMENT: Rather than add in the numbers with the text, you can use an ordered list as coded below.-->

            <ol>
               <li>Feedback loops and their Behavior: Systems Thinking focuses on how outputs on a system will loop back as inputs, which influences that system behavior in the future. Reinforcing these loops and speed up changes, while keeping them balanced can stabilize behaviors. Linear thinking does not take these variables into account.</li>
               <li>Emergence: Complex systems will often show behavior categorized as “emergent”, meaning that they cannot be predicted by analyzing components by themselves. For an example, the collective user behavior on a website can project itself as patterns that were never specifically coded for.</li>
               <li>Mental Models: Systems thinking encourages using the mental models, these are internal representations that form how we interpret a system. Identifying these mental models helps reveal these assumptions and broadens systems boundaries, including people, environments, and policies.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These characteristics steeply contrast reductionist, linear approaches that can assume that problems are easily solved by breaking them down into smaller, contextless pieces.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Approaches</h3>
            <p>While systems thinking provides the framework, utilizing model-based designs gives tools to reason with complex systems. Models can start as simplified representations of the world, diagrams, simulations, maps and more. These overall are mea</p>
            <p>This appraoch is valuable for several reasons:</p>

<!--INSTRUCTOR COMMENT: Now, you can edit this one to create an ordered list.-->

            <ul>
               <li>1.	Interdependencies: Models like a causal loop diagram or other system maps can explicitly show relationships. Rather than expecting a developer to know how a microservice can interact with others, these models clearly show those links, along with tracking dependencies, and exposing hidden couplings throughout the system. This is extremely helpful when teams and codebases are massive.</li>
               <li>2.	Scenario Exploration: Models allow designers to test hypothetical scenarios before deploying any actual changes, that way any effects can be observed and compensated for. For an example, digital designers could see how changing an onboarding flow might change user retention and its support load.</li>
               <li>3.	Communication: Models can serve as shared artifacts across different subjects – UX, system engineering, management, developer operations – aligning expectations and production languages. Without these shared models, confusion can arise quickly in decision making.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The academic piece on SYMBIOSIS emphasizes this point: allowing frameworks and models through systems thinking accessible – especially with AI and machine intelligent systems – dramatically improves formulation for problems and reduce barriers to a better understanding of complex structures (Sethi et al., 2025). This work showcases that models are not optional extras; they act as bridges to simplify super complex dynamics into representations that are much more interpretable.</p>
            <h3>Applications to Digital Design</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking has actual benefits in designing digital systems:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>1.	Leverage Points: Rather than optimizing performance metrics for efficiency, designers can look for leverage points, where small changes can have a massive turnaround or effect on the rest of the system.</li>
               <li>2.	Unintended Consequences: Changes often end up backfiring when secondary effects are brushed off. For example, streamlining a checkout process can help increase conversions but could also overload customer support if not coupled with better help services. Model-based analysis is helpful for capturing these effects.</li>
               <li>3.	Fostering Innovation: Systems thinking prioritizes long-term viability over short term fixing. In Law of UX, there is an emphasis on human psychology and a reminder to designers to think about users as more than just a number, but as a participant in a system whose expectations will shape the system’s evolution (Yablonski, 2025).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Complex digital systems act more like ecosystems than just machines. The dynamics of these systems come from intertwining technical, social, and behavioral elements. Linear thinking falls short in capturing this type of complexity.</p>
            <p>Systems thinking takes the focus from individual elements to internal relationships and patterns over time. It allows designers to map feedback, revisit assumptions, and find leverage points that could influence system behavior. When pairing with a model-based approach, systems thinking becomes much more flexible, models showcase assumptions, facilitate collaboration, and make interactions tangible.</p>
            <p>In the realm of digital design, systems thinking with modeling isn’t just helpful, it is necessary for creating resilient, adaptable, and human-oriented technology.</p>
