            <h3>Designing for the Long Haul: Life Cycle Thinking in Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>In today’s digital and interconnected world, engineering systems demand more than just technical expertise or the creation of functional products. Successful systems engineering is about managing complexity, anticipating system evolution, and designing with long-term value and adaptability in mind. At the core of this philosophy lies the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)—a structured methodology that enables engineers to manage each stage of a system’s journey, from initial planning to eventual decommissioning.</p>

<p>This blog post explores the SDLC and takes a deeper look into three core life cycle models: linear, iterative, and incremental. These models shape how engineers approach development and decision-making over time. The post also integrates systems thinking, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), and human-centered design principles—drawing on Jeff Johnson’s <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em>—to show how user needs and system longevity are both critical to effective engineering.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h3>
<p>The SDLC provides a framework for developing and managing systems through distinct phases: concept development, requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, operation, maintenance, and retirement (INCOSE, 2015). These stages ensure a holistic view—incorporating not just the technical aspects of a system, but also human, financial, and operational considerations throughout its lifespan.</p>

<h3>Systems Thinking: A Holistic Engineering Perspective</h3>
<p>Systems thinking encourages engineers to understand the dynamic relationships between components within a system. It highlights how local decisions can influence broader system behavior. According to <em>Systems Engineering Demystified</em> (n.d.), this mindset shifts focus from isolated problem-solving to viewing systems as interconnected wholes that interact with their users and environments.</p>

<h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)</h3>
<p>MBSE replaces static documents with interactive, digital models that improve communication, traceability, and early validation (INCOSE, 2015). These models are particularly effective in life cycle models like iterative and incremental, where requirements and solutions evolve through feedback loops and stakeholder engagement.</p>

<h3>Human-Centered Design: Learning from Cognitive Psychology</h3>
<p>Jeff Johnson (2020) stresses that many system usability failures occur when design ignores how people perceive, think, and behave. Human-centered design, grounded in cognitive psychology, aims to align system behavior with mental models, reduce cognitive load, and create intuitive experiences. Involving users early and consistently helps produce systems that are both efficient and user-friendly.</p>

<h3>Comparing Life Cycle Models</h3>
<p>Choosing the right development model can significantly affect system success. Each life cycle model offers unique strengths and limitations depending on the project context, complexity, and level of requirement uncertainty.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Linear (Waterfall Model):</strong> This model follows a strict, sequential order of phases. It is best suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements—such as government systems or infrastructure projects—where major changes during development are not expected. However, the linear model is inflexible and offers little opportunity to revisit earlier phases once they’re completed, which can lead to inefficiencies if problems emerge late in the process.</li>

  <li><strong>Iterative Model:</strong> The iterative model embraces uncertainty by cycling through repeated phases of development and refinement. Each iteration produces a prototype that can be evaluated and improved. This approach is useful when requirements are unclear or evolving, such as in machine learning systems or UX-intensive applications. It enables continuous stakeholder feedback and aligns well with MBSE, which supports visual modeling and refinement throughout iterations.</li>

  <li><strong>Incremental Model:</strong> In this model, the system is built and delivered in smaller components, or increments. Each part adds to the previous one, offering partial functionality early and allowing for ongoing testing and user validation. It's ideal for modular systems, such as enterprise software or mobile apps, where risk can be minimized by validating key features before the full system is delivered.</li>
</ul>

<p>In today’s practice, many engineering teams use hybrid models that combine elements of iterative and incremental approaches—like Agile frameworks. These allow for adaptability, continuous delivery, and rapid response to change. Ultimately, life cycle thinking requires choosing or tailoring a model not just based on technical goals, but also on user needs, stakeholder engagement, and long-term maintainability.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>By understanding and applying principles from systems thinking, MBSE, and user-centered design, engineers can design systems that are robust, sustainable, and adaptable. Whether applying a linear, iterative, or incremental model, the key is to select the approach that best supports flexibility, system longevity, and stakeholder alignment. A thoughtful life cycle strategy transforms engineering from short-term implementation to long-term system stewardship.</p>

    <h2>Designing to Meet Human Needs: The Importance of Perception, Empathy, and Usability</h2>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>What does it take to design in a way that serves people? This question—while seemingly simple—is the foundation of human-centered design (HCD). HCD places people, not technology, at the center of the design process. It emphasizes empathy, iteration, and deep attention to how people see, think, and act in the real world. As digital systems increasingly shape our lives, designers bear a responsibility to create solutions that align with human perception and experience—not just business goals (IDEO.org, 2015).</p>

    <p>Design goes far beyond appearance. It is about solving problems in ways that resonate with users. This post explores how HCD frameworks like <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/52075.html" target="_blank">ISO 9241-210</a> and <a href="https://www.designkit.org/resources/1" target="_blank">IDEO’s Field Guide</a> intersect with concepts of perception, attention, and key UX laws. When used together, they create more inclusive, intuitive, and human-driven experiences.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Human-Centered Design: Building Empathy into Solutions</h3>
    <p>Human-centered design is a structured yet flexible approach to solving design challenges by focusing on users’ real contexts, behaviors, and feedback. It doesn’t just involve users after a product is developed—it includes them at every phase. The goal is to create systems that not only work, but feel natural and trustworthy (DIN, 2019).</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.designkit.org/resources/1" target="_blank">IDEO Field Guide to Human-Centered Design</a> champions creativity, curiosity, and empathy. It outlines a five-phase process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Each stage builds on user understanding, promoting co-creation over assumptions (IDEO.org, 2015).</p>

    <p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/52075.html" target="_blank">ISO 9241-210</a> provides a formal framework for applying HCD in technical systems. It emphasizes six key activities: understanding context, specifying user requirements, producing design solutions, evaluating those solutions, iterating based on findings, and involving users throughout (DIN, 2019). The structure ensures usability principles are embedded from the beginning—not treated as an afterthought.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Seeing and Thinking: Perception, Attention, and the Interface</h3>
    <p>How users visually perceive information determines how they interact with interfaces. Perception shapes what users notice first, while attention filters which elements are processed. When designers understand these processes, they can guide attention toward what matters most (Wolfe & Horowitz, 2004).</p>

    <p>Visual hierarchy is one of the most important tools for this. It organizes interface elements by their importance. A brightly colored call-to-action button placed in a central location draws attention instantly. According to Wolfe and Horowitz (2004), visual features such as color, contrast, and motion attract attention through “pre-attentive processing.” This means users may notice these elements before consciously thinking about them.</p>

    <p>But perception has limits. Our brains can’t process every detail at once. Poor visual hierarchy causes cognitive friction, forcing users to stop, think, and search—rather than flow smoothly through tasks. Designs that match natural patterns of vision and cognition are easier to use and more enjoyable (Johnson, 2014).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Key UX Laws: Jakob's, Fitts's, Hick's, and Miller's</h3>
    <p>Designers can anticipate and address usability issues by applying foundational UX laws. These psychological principles help make systems feel intuitive. Here’s how each applies in practice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Jakob’s Law:</strong> People expect digital experiences to be similar to those they've used before. When websites place the shopping cart in the top-right corner or use standard icons for navigation, they reduce friction. As Nielsen (2000) explains, consistency breeds usability and comfort.</li>

      <li><strong>Fitts’s Law:</strong> This law suggests that the time to reach a target depends on its size and distance. Small or far-away buttons slow users down. On mobile interfaces, making buttons larger and closer to natural touch zones improves interaction speed and accuracy (DIN, 2019).</li>

      <li><strong>Hick’s Law:</strong> More choices increase decision time. This principle underlies why designers break down complex tasks into smaller steps. For example, online forms that reveal only one question at a time reduce cognitive overload and improve completion rates (Sharma, 2021).</li>

      <li><strong>Miller’s Law:</strong> People can hold 7±2 items in working memory. Designers use this law to group related content and avoid showing too many elements at once. Interfaces that respect this cognitive limit feel manageable and friendly (Johnson, 2014).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Used together, these laws ensure interfaces align with how people naturally think and act. They turn user behavior from a mystery into a roadmap.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Empathy in Design: A Subtle Force</h3>
    <p>While cognitive science guides structure, empathy gives design its soul. Empathy allows designers to understand not only what users do, but why they do it. The IDEO Field Guide emphasizes the power of observation, deep interviews, and storytelling. Through these techniques, designers see beyond functionality and into emotional needs (IDEO.org, 2015).</p>

    <p>ISO 9241-210 formalizes empathy by requiring designers to “specify the context of use.” This involves studying physical settings, social dynamics, and limitations such as literacy or access (DIN, 2019). When done well, empathy ensures the solution respects the whole human—not just the interface user.</p>

    <p>Empathy also helps designers avoid one-size-fits-all assumptions. For example, building tools for people with visual impairments, low bandwidth access, or language barriers requires stepping into unfamiliar shoes. Great design doesn’t assume—it asks, listens, and adapts.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Example: A Public Health App</h3>
    <p>Let’s consider a mobile app created to help parents in underserved communities track child vaccinations. The design team begins by applying ISO 9241-210: they study the environment—shared phones, limited digital literacy, and inconsistent internet access (DIN, 2019).</p>

    <p>Following IDEO’s process, they host community workshops to co-create solutions. Early sketches are tested with paper prototypes. Through empathy-driven research, they discover that users prefer icons over long text and want reminders tied to local health centers (IDEO.org, 2015).</p>

    <p>Applying UX laws strengthens the interface. Fitts’s Law leads to large, tappable buttons. Hick’s Law ensures each screen has no more than three choices (Sharma, 2021). Miller’s Law encourages chunked flows (Johnson, 2014). Jakob’s Law guides layout decisions—mirroring common health apps to reduce learning time (Nielsen, 2000).</p>

    <p>The result is more than a usable product—it’s a trusted tool that reflects local needs and values. Through perception, empathy, and iteration, the team builds something useful and respectful.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Final Thought: Design With People, Not Just for Them</h3>
    <p>Human-centered design is not just a method—it’s a mindset. It challenges us to listen, to see, and to care. The ISO 9241-210 framework provides structure and rigor, while IDEO’s Field Guide invites imagination and openness. Together, they help us design with—not just for—people (DIN, 2019; IDEO.org, 2015).</p>

    <p>By grounding our choices in how users perceive and process information, and by applying UX laws rooted in psychology, we reduce friction and increase clarity. But above all, it is empathy that transforms good design into meaningful design. When we truly understand users, we create not just usable systems—but experiences that matter.</p>

    <p>The future of design isn’t about screens or systems. It’s about people. The most enduring products are those that make people feel seen, supported, and empowered.</p>

    <h1>Thinking with the Interface</h1>
  </header>
        
          <section class="article-body">
            <p>Good design doesn’t just look appealing—it supports the way users think, act, and remember. Interfaces aren’t just tools; they are cognitive environments that either help or hinder users in completing tasks efficiently. With increasing complexity in digital systems, understanding the relationship between human cognition and interface design is crucial. This blog post will explore how memory, mental models, feedback, and consistency contribute to usability, and how poor designs can impose unnecessary cognitive load.</p>
        
            <h3>Mental Models and Memory</h3>
            <p>When users interact with an interface, they rely on what are known as mental models—internal representations of how they believe a system should work. These models are formed from prior experiences with other systems and inform expectations. For example, when using a new email client, users expect to find a 'compose' button somewhere at the top left or right, because that’s where it is in Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo. Breaking from this expectation confuses users.</p>
            <p>Memory also plays a vital role. According to George Miller’s law, our working memory can only retain about 7±2 items at once. Designers must therefore avoid interfaces that require users to remember information across multiple steps. In <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em>, Johnson (2020) highlights how recognition-based interfaces outperform recall-based ones. Recognizing icons, options, or paths significantly lowers mental strain compared to remembering exact commands or steps.</p>
            <p>Amazon’s 1-click ordering exemplifies this principle. Once users associate the button with a successful transaction, they mentally model that action as trustworthy. No lengthy forms or repeated confirmations are required—just a single, predictable action. This reduces memory burden and streamlines the decision-making process.</p>
        
            <figure>
              <img src="images/feedback.jpg" alt="Thumbs up and down in speech bubbles representing user feedback." width="600">
              <figcaption>Clear visual cues (like thumbs up/down) reinforce user confidence through immediate feedback.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <h3>Consistency and Feedback</h3>
            <p>One of the most effective ways to reduce cognitive load is through consistency. Jakob’s Law, discussed in <em>The Laws of UX</em> (Babich, 2019), states that users prefer your site to function like other familiar platforms. When layouts, colors, or labels change arbitrarily, users are forced to relearn patterns, increasing the likelihood of errors and abandonment.</p>
            <p>Feedback, on the other hand, provides immediate reassurance. Systems that respond to user actions—through animations, messages, or sound—help users feel in control. Consider Google Docs: when you type, a “Saving…” message appears, followed by “All changes saved.” This micro-interaction prevents user anxiety about data loss and improves overall satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Compare that to a multi-step web form that, upon pressing "Submit", erases all data and provides no error message if something was filled incorrectly. Users feel frustrated, not only because their time was wasted, but because the system failed to communicate.</p>
        
            <h3>Recognition vs. Recall</h3>
            <p>Another foundational cognitive principle in UX is the distinction between recognition and recall. Recognition is passive and triggered by external cues, whereas recall requires active memory retrieval. Interfaces should rely more on the former.</p>
            <p>Consider the difference between typing a command into a terminal versus clicking an icon on a GUI. The latter is more user-friendly for the average person. Spotify, for example, uses clearly labeled icons and playlist thumbnails. If users had to recall exact artist names or song titles without suggestions or images, the app would be far less usable.</p>
            <p>Well-designed interfaces also offer visual continuity. Netflix, for instance, displays previously watched episodes, recommendations, and progress bars. Users are guided through their experience based on what they see—not what they have to remember.</p>
        
            <figure>
              <img src="images/frustrated.jpg" alt="Frustrated user with question marks and charts floating above." width="600">
              <figcaption>When mental effort exceeds our cognitive limit, frustration and failure quickly follow.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <h3>Cognitive Load and Tesler’s Law</h3>
            <p>Cognitive load is the mental effort required to use a system. Designs that reduce unnecessary choices or ambiguity are more effective. Tesler’s Law tells us that "every application has an inherent amount of complexity. The job of the designer is to manage it."</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, many systems shift this complexity onto users. Airline booking forms often ask for seating preferences, fare class, loyalty numbers, and insurance details—before showing available flights. This overloads users at the wrong time. A better approach would sequence these steps and reduce the visible fields at each stage, like what Hopper or Skyscanner do.</p>
            <p>Duolingo illustrates good practice by letting learners make one choice at a time. Each lesson builds on past lessons, reinforcing learning without overwhelming. The interface uses bright icons, progress indicators, and encouraging messages. These combine to reduce mental strain while reinforcing motivation.</p>
        
            <h3>Good Design in Practice</h3>
            <p>The CarPoolin app interface below is a model of minimal cognitive load. First, the home screen uses friendly imagery that immediately communicates its purpose: travel and savings. Next, users are guided step-by-step—from selecting destination, date, to passenger count. Each action is visual, intuitive, and consistent with mobile norms.</p>
        
            <figure>
              <img src="images/ui.jpg" alt="Minimalist mobile UI with clear flow and buttons." width="600">

              <figcaption>A clean UI with minimal cognitive load: clear goals, logical sequence, and immediate feedback.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <p>This design aligns perfectly with users’ mental models of ride-sharing and travel booking apps. It avoids redundant fields, reduces the need for typing, and provides immediate feedback through button states and confirmations. More importantly, it respects the user's time and attention—two of the most valuable digital currencies today.</p>
            <p>Compare this to a cluttered interface with dropdowns hidden under tabs, unclear icons, and no error recovery. Every misstep costs attention and patience. A well-designed interface is silent—it simply works.</p>
        
            <h3>Case Study: Poor Design and High Cognitive Load</h3>
            <p>Consider the user experience of an older tax filing system used in many countries before modernization efforts. The interface was filled with jargon, no tooltips, no inline validation, and mandatory multi-page forms that didn’t save progress. Users were expected to calculate deductions manually, understand legal tax language, and format values precisely to avoid rejection.</p>
            <p>This system not only violated best practices but ignored Tesler’s Law entirely. Complexity was dumped onto the user. The resulting experience was one of anxiety, confusion, and frequent errors. Redesigns of these systems now include guided flows, help text, autocomplete, and live chat support—features that recognize user limitations and ease mental effort.</p>
        
            <h3>Designing for Accessibility and Cognitive Differences</h3>
            <p>Designing with cognition in mind is especially vital for users with ADHD, dyslexia, or age-related cognitive decline. A design that minimizes distractions, uses predictable layouts, and offers progressive disclosure (showing information as needed) can dramatically improve usability for these groups.</p>
            <p>For example, Apple's iOS “Focus” mode and interface simplifications benefit not only neurodivergent users but everyone. Similarly, readable fonts, ample spacing, and avoidance of scrolling text improve comprehension. These aren’t just ethical considerations—they enhance performance and satisfaction across all user types.</p>
            <p>Inclusive design respects the diversity of human cognition and acknowledges that everyone benefits when systems are clear, predictable, and accommodating. As Norman (2013) argued, design should be for how people actually behave—not how we wish they behaved.</p>
        
            <h3>Future Directions: Cognitive Design in the Age of AI</h3>
            <p>As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly embedded in everyday interfaces—from voice assistants to recommendation engines—understanding user cognition is more important than ever. Systems now adapt to users in real time, but poor cognitive alignment can lead to confusion and loss of trust.</p>
            <p>Consider AI chatbots: if their responses lack transparency or fail to reflect users' mental models of a helpful assistant, users may abandon them quickly. Similarly, algorithmic recommendation systems (like those on YouTube or Netflix) need to strike a balance between novelty and familiarity. Too much change disrupts consistency; too little feels stale.</p>
            <p>Emerging trends in UX include adaptive interfaces, context-aware simplification, and emotion-sensing feedback loops. These aim to align system behavior even more closely with how humans perceive, decide, and remember. But the fundamentals remain the same—respect memory limits, reduce load, and build around real mental models.</p>
        
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Design is not just about aesthetics—it's about empathy. It’s about knowing that your user is a human with limited time, limited memory, and a desire for clarity. By embracing cognitive principles like recognition over recall, consistent structure, immediate feedback, and minimizing unnecessary load, designers can create systems that feel intuitive and delightful.</p>
            <p>Tesler’s Law reminds us: complexity exists, but it’s our job to manage it—not pass it on to the user. From tax systems to mobile apps, and from accessibility to AI, design should meet users where they are—supporting, guiding, and never overwhelming. Cognitive-based design is not just smart UX—it’s human-centered thinking at its best.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>LinkedIn, with more than 900 million users globally as of 2025, stands as the world’s leading platform for professional networking. It offers a range of features designed to help users manage their professional identities, build connections, search and apply for jobs, share content, and follow companies and influencers. Despite its scale, the success of LinkedIn depends on how well its interface facilitates intuitive, goal-directed user interaction. Poor design could turn opportunity into confusion, while effective UX logic helps people navigate their careers with clarity and confidence.</p>

    <p>This blog post presents a comprehensive analysis of LinkedIn’s interface structure and logic. Drawing upon cognitive psychology, usability heuristics, and principles from user experience (UX) design, the evaluation will highlight both positive and frustrating experiences using LinkedIn. It also applies three foundational UX laws—the Aesthetic–Usability Effect, the Von Restorff Effect, and Postel’s Law—along with references from core course readings such as Johnson’s <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> and Lidwell’s <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>. The final goal is to demonstrate how thoughtful interface decisions shape perception, guide behavior, and build trust.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Positive Experience: Clear Navigation and Predictable Layout</h2>
    <p>One of LinkedIn’s greatest strengths lies in its interface consistency and intuitive navigation design. From the moment a user logs in, the interface offers a streamlined and familiar top navigation bar that includes key sections like “Home,” “My Network,” “Jobs,” “Messaging,” and “Notifications.” These are supported by universal icons and meaningful labels, ensuring quick recognition. This structure reflects Jakob’s Law, which states that users prefer interfaces that behave similarly to ones they have already experienced. The layout closely mirrors other high-use platforms such as Facebook or Google, making it immediately familiar—even for new users.</p>

    <p>According to Chapter 10 of Johnson’s <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em>, good UX minimizes memory load and promotes the recognition of patterns. LinkedIn applies this principle by keeping its main functions accessible via top-level navigation while relegating secondary options—such as settings, privacy, or help—to drop-down menus. This spatial hierarchy reduces visual clutter and focuses the user’s attention on frequent tasks. Consistency in positioning, design, and language supports rapid orientation, especially among users who access the site multiple times per week.</p>

    <p>The structure of user profiles on LinkedIn also enhances learnability and clarity. Each profile features a large banner, followed by the user’s name, headline, contact info, and experience, laid out in a clear vertical hierarchy. This layout supports the principle of progressive disclosure: more detailed information appears lower on the page, after the most critical data. The organization is not only visually coherent but also supports scanning—a key factor for recruiters and hiring managers.</p>

    <p>Additionally, interaction feedback is strong. When hovering over buttons such as “Connect” or “Message,” users receive immediate visual changes, often supported by tooltips. These microinteractions reinforce that the controls are functional, clickable, and safe to explore. This aligns with what Johnson (2014) refers to as “perceptible affordances”—elements that naturally indicate their function without the need for instructions. Visual feedback through color changes and icon animation keeps users oriented and confident in their actions.</p>

    <p>On a visual level, LinkedIn’s design benefits from the Aesthetic–Usability Effect, a UX law that suggests users perceive more attractive interfaces as easier to use (Lidwell et al., 2010). The site’s use of a professional blue-and-white palette, sans-serif fonts, and liberal use of whitespace cultivates a sense of reliability and order. Users are more tolerant of minor usability flaws when the overall experience “feels” polished. For example, even if a search query produces limited results, the clean layout and responsive controls reduce frustration.</p>

      <img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="LinkedIn navigation bar screenshot">
      <figcaption>Figure 1. LinkedIn’s navigation bar uses recognizable icons and labels that align with user expectations.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Another beneficial design choice is the dashboard area on user homepages, which provides contextual feedback about profile views, search appearances, and post engagements. These summary cards present data in a simple, digestible format that supports user learning. As noted in usability studies, feedback should be relevant, timely, and clearly presented to support task efficiency. LinkedIn succeeds in this aspect by not overwhelming the user with raw data, but instead offering top-level summaries with optional drill-down links.</p>

    <p>In short, LinkedIn’s navigation and visual design work well because they harmonize usability principles with polished aesthetics. The interface minimizes friction, supports exploration, and encourages engagement without overwhelming the user. These are the signs of a mature, experience-centered design philosophy that puts user needs front and center.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>UX Laws in Action: Von Restorff Effect and Postel’s Law</h2>
  <p>In addition to Jakob’s Law and the Aesthetic–Usability Effect, LinkedIn applies other UX laws to improve interface logic and flow. One of the most impactful examples is the Von Restorff Effect, which states that items that stand out are more likely to be remembered. LinkedIn incorporates this principle through the green “Open to Work” and purple “Hiring” profile banners. These features not only attract recruiter attention but also help users position themselves visually within their network. The stark contrast of these badges against the platform’s muted color scheme ensures they catch the eye.</p>

  <p>This use of visual distinctiveness also extends to interface callouts such as “Top Applicant” and “Remote” tags on job postings. These brightly colored elements contrast sharply with LinkedIn’s minimalist interface and signal meaningful distinctions without requiring users to read through large blocks of text. As explained in Chapter 8 of <em>The Laws of UX</em>, the Von Restorff Effect enhances visual hierarchy and helps guide scanning behavior—both of which are essential on a platform with dense information architecture.</p>

  <p>Another important law applied in LinkedIn’s design is Postel’s Law, also known as the Robustness Principle: “Be liberal in what you accept from others, and conservative in what you send.” This is particularly evident in the platform’s handling of user input. For example, the search bar can process incomplete keywords, autocorrect spelling errors, and still return relevant suggestions. Whether users are looking for “marketng manager” or “data anlyst,” LinkedIn attempts to understand and interpret intent rather than reject faulty inputs outright. This flexibility reduces frustration and supports inclusive use among non-native English speakers or users on mobile devices.</p>

  <p>Postel’s Law also emerges in messaging and connection workflows. Even if a message lacks punctuation or capitalization, the interface interprets it correctly. When adding connections, users don’t need to manually type a message—LinkedIn auto-generates a polite, customizable default. These small design decisions embody what Norman (2013) identifies as "error tolerance"—designs that anticipate mistakes and still allow users to succeed.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 2. LinkedIn applies the Von Restorff Effect through visually distinctive profile elements.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Microinteractions like hover previews, loading indicators, and real-time feedback are all reinforced by Chapter 11 of Johnson’s <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em>, which states that clear, perceptible feedback enhances user trust and task fluency. When a user clicks on a job or connection, subtle animations and loaders maintain engagement and reduce perceived delay. These small signals, though often unnoticed, play a critical role in maintaining the user’s sense of flow and control.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Frustrating Experience: Feed Overload and Ambiguity</h2>
  <p>Despite many well-executed elements, LinkedIn’s interface is not without flaws. Chief among these is the cluttered homepage feed, which can feel overwhelming and unstructured. Users are bombarded with a mix of updates, ads, suggestions, job posts, and promotional messages—many of which are algorithmically prioritized but not necessarily relevant. This overload creates cognitive friction, contradicting Hick’s Law, which posits that decision time increases with the number and complexity of choices (Nielsen, 2020).</p>

  <p>For a platform designed around professional focus, the sheer volume of content makes it difficult to zero in on meaningful interactions. Scrolling through the homepage often feels like swimming through a river of noise, where occasional valuable posts are buried between recruiter shoutouts and AI-generated fluff. Worse, users have little control over what appears first. While the “Sort by Top” or “Recent” toggle exists, content filtering remains limited.</p>

  <p>Another friction point is the ambiguous feedback users receive when performing important actions. Take, for example, the “Easy Apply” feature. While the name implies simplicity, the reality can be confusing. After clicking the button and submitting a form, users are briefly shown a confirmation message—but no further guidance is given. Was the application successful? Will they be contacted? Who reviewed it? These questions are left unanswered. Chapter 12 of <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> emphasizes that successful interfaces reduce ambiguity by making system status visible at all times (Johnson, 2014). LinkedIn fails this test.</p>

  <p>Even worse, this lack of clarity increases user anxiety during critical moments—especially for job seekers. When the outcome of a submission is unclear, users are less likely to trust the process or return for repeat use. It becomes evident that although the interaction technically functions, it doesn’t fulfill its emotional and informational responsibilities.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="Overloaded LinkedIn feed">
    <figcaption>Figure 3. Excessive feed content introduces friction, violating Hick’s Law and reducing engagement.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The platform also struggles with content redundancy. Duplicate updates, repeated job postings, and overly generalized suggestions clog the user interface, further complicating navigation. Some users report seeing the same content repeatedly or being shown jobs that are irrelevant based on their profile data—highlighting flaws in personalization algorithms and content filtering heuristics.</p>

  <p>All of these issues add up to a degraded user experience, where users feel more like passive consumers of algorithmic noise than active participants in a tailored professional network. To improve, LinkedIn must re-center the user’s cognitive bandwidth—focusing attention, reducing distractions, and offering transparency throughout the experience.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Emotional Design and User Trust</h2>
  <p>Beyond usability, LinkedIn’s interface has significant emotional implications. The platform is tied deeply to identity, reputation, and personal success. Whether users are announcing a new job, requesting a recommendation, or responding to a recruiter, the emotions involved range from pride to vulnerability. Don Norman (2013) notes that successful emotional design fosters user attachment by making people feel seen, supported, and successful. LinkedIn achieves this in part—but often misses key opportunities.</p>

  <p>Positive interactions such as endorsement notifications or thoughtful comments reinforce belonging and engagement. These micro-rewards play a psychological role in keeping users returning. However, when notifications are vague (e.g., “Someone viewed your profile”) or appear to be algorithmically generated, they lose emotional resonance. Chapter 11 of <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> highlights that users expect feedback to be both timely and meaningful—an area where LinkedIn sometimes falters.</p>

  <p>Emotional trust is further undermined when LinkedIn surfaces system-generated content—like AI-written posts or “celebrate work anniversary” messages—that feel impersonal. Although these tools aim to increase engagement, they often dilute the human tone of interaction. For a platform rooted in professional authenticity, these patterns can seem hollow or disingenuous, ultimately eroding trust in the medium itself.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Mobile UX: Inconsistencies and Cognitive Disruption</h2>
  <p>LinkedIn’s mobile app—while responsive and visually aligned with its desktop counterpart—often introduces unexpected cognitive friction. Navigation items sometimes shift position, and gestures behave inconsistently across platforms. For example, a job post viewed on desktop may reappear in an unexpected order on mobile. More frustrating is when the feed resets or reloads entirely, causing users to lose their place.</p>

  <p>This inconsistency undermines what Norman (2013) refers to as the user’s “internal model”—their expectations of how the system behaves. On mobile, actions like editing profiles or viewing analytics are unnecessarily buried, requiring multiple taps and detours. Additionally, the app lacks persistent scroll memory in several views. If a user reads a job, taps on the company, then returns, they are placed back at the top of the feed. These lapses disrupt flow and contradict established usability heuristics around minimal memory load and continuity of experience.</p>

  <p>To maintain flow across devices, LinkedIn must strengthen its mobile strategy by ensuring interface predictability, gesture compatibility, and consistent feedback patterns. Users expect mobile experiences to be just as robust, fluid, and empowering as desktop ones—especially on a career-focused platform used during commutes, in between meetings, and on the go.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Recommendations: Designing for Clarity, Flow, and Empathy</h2>
  <p>Based on the analysis above, the following design recommendations could significantly improve the LinkedIn user experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Streamline the feed:</strong> Allow users to personalize what types of content are prioritized (e.g., industry updates vs. career milestones). Implement smarter filters to reduce repetition and increase relevance.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhance feedback in job applications:</strong> Provide a clear post-application screen with visual confirmation, recruiter info (if available), and next steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve mobile consistency:</strong> Add scroll memory, support deep-linking, and standardize gesture interactions across iOS and Android versions.</li>
    <li><strong>Humanize notifications:</strong> Reword system-generated alerts to feel more personal and contextual. Avoid robotic tones.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase transparency:</strong> Offer an explanation for algorithmic decisions like why a certain job or post is shown—building trust through informed engagement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With these improvements, LinkedIn could not only reduce user friction but also enhance professional confidence, emotional connection, and loyalty across its ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Interaction Timing, Feedback, and Emotional Memory</h2>

    <p>User experience (UX) is not merely about functionality or layout—it’s deeply rooted in how users feel when they interact with a system. Great UX design centers around emotions and memory, and the mechanisms that influence those perceptions. Timing, responsiveness, and feedback aren’t surface-level features; they are the invisible threads that shape trust, engagement, and satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Let’s begin with the <strong>Peak–End Rule</strong>, a principle proposed by psychologist Daniel Kahneman. It states that people remember experiences based on the emotional peaks and how they end—not necessarily on the sum of all moments. This rule applies heavily in UX design. Imagine a shopping experience where everything flows smoothly, but the final checkout screen is confusing or fails to confirm the order clearly. That single moment can tarnish the entire experience, despite the rest going well (Kahneman, 1999).</p>

    <p>I encountered this in a design project for a university's class registration tool. We received user complaints about frustration—even though the platform technically worked. By examining the flow, we found the confirmation message was plain and delayed. By adding a responsive animation and a clear, personalized message (“You’re registered for Fall!”), user satisfaction scores improved significantly. A small change at the emotional “end” of the journey transformed user memory.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/image.c.jpg" alt="User giving feedback via smartphone interface">

    </figure>

    <p>Another key principle is the <strong>Doherty Threshold</strong>, which suggests that interfaces should respond within 400 milliseconds to keep users engaged. The longer a user waits without feedback, the more anxious or irritated they become (Lidwell et al., 2010). This is why responsive design is so important—users feel respected and in control when systems respond quickly and clearly.</p>

    <p>Think about loading indicators. When an interface delays and offers no visual response, users might click again or assume it's broken. That uncertainty leads to stress. A simple spinner, progress bar, or animated placeholder signals that the system is working, preserving user trust. Feedback reassures us our action was recognized—even if the task takes longer.</p>

    <p>Audible and haptic feedback are other subtle yet powerful tools. Phone vibrations when typing, clicking sounds, or visual pulses help users feel connected to the interface. As Johnson (2020) notes, humans are biologically wired to seek confirmation—we want to know “Did that work?” even if the action is minor.</p>

    <p><strong>Motion design</strong> also affects perception. Smooth transitions help users build spatial awareness within digital environments. When one page fades into another or elements slide naturally into place, it mirrors real-world movement and reduces cognitive effort. In a usability test, I saw users describe a basic dashboard as “cold and static,” until we added micro-interactions such as hover animations and entry transitions. Suddenly, it felt “alive.”</p>

    <p>Importantly, motion must serve function, not decoration. A loading animation that delights for one second is good UX—but one that loops excessively causes frustration. And too much animation without purpose can be disorienting, especially for neurodivergent users or those with vestibular sensitivities. UX should always balance aesthetics and accessibility.</p>

    <p>Interaction design is not about gimmicks; it’s about emotional intelligence. Thoughtful timing and feedback make users feel understood and respected. These choices don’t just improve performance—they shape memory and build loyalty. When users walk away feeling good, they come back.</p>

    <p>In summary, designing for emotional memory isn’t optional—it’s fundamental. Laws like the Peak–End Rule and Doherty Threshold provide guidance, but lived experience and reflection make them actionable. By focusing on timely feedback, seamless motion, and human-centered flow, we can craft interfaces that feel trustworthy and even joyful.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>UX Laws, Motion, and Interface Intuition</h2>

  <p>Interaction design isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about creating experiences that feel seamless, intuitive, and psychologically sound. To design experiences that “just work,” we must rely on cognitive principles and proven user experience (UX) laws. These include Fitts’s Law, Jakob’s Law, Tesler’s Law, and others that provide guidance on how humans interact with technology. When we build with these rules in mind, we reduce friction, improve learnability, and empower users.</p>

  <p><strong>Fitts’s Law</strong> is foundational in interface design. It states that the time to reach a target depends on the size of the target and the distance to it. In UX, this translates into the importance of clickable areas. A large button that is close to the expected action flow is easier to hit than a small, faraway one. This is especially important on mobile devices where thumbs are less precise than cursors. Consider how frequently-used actions in apps like Instagram—such as the home or like button—are placed at the bottom of the screen, within thumb range. This is Fitts’s Law in action.</p>

  <p>Then there’s <strong>Jakob’s Law</strong>: “Users spend most of their time on other websites.” This law teaches us that familiarity breeds usability. People come to new apps with expectations shaped by common design conventions. If your navigation menu breaks common patterns or your form fields behave differently than those on similar platforms, you risk confusing your users. Good design is not about being radically different—it’s about meeting users where they are. A weather app shouldn’t surprise users with hidden navigation or unconventional gestures. The less users have to learn, the faster they accomplish their goals.</p>

  <p><strong>Tesler’s Law</strong>, also known as the Law of Conservation of Complexity, reminds us that every application has inherent complexity. The key is deciding who should manage it: the system or the user. Ethical and effective UX design hides unnecessary technical detail and presents information progressively. A great example is Google’s minimalist homepage—it offers a single search bar, hiding the complex algorithms behind it. This makes a powerful system feel simple.</p>

  <p>Beyond laws, motion plays an often-underestimated role in interface usability. Motion design isn’t just eye candy—it gives users feedback, helps guide attention, and establishes relationships between elements. For instance, when you drag a card and it follows your finger with realistic momentum, your brain interprets this as an object with weight and physics. This natural mapping enhances comprehension.</p>

  <p>Microinteractions—tiny animations triggered by user actions—are a prime example. A heart that animates when clicked, a shake when a form fails, or a “swipe to delete” motion all convey clear meaning. These moments help users feel connected to the system. In a usability study I conducted, users responded more positively to a form that included animations than to a static one. The motion guided their focus and reduced their cognitive load during data entry.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="images/image.b.jpg" alt="Clean user interface showing visual hierarchy and motion cues">
    <figcaption>Image by medium. Licensed under medium License.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>However, motion must be purposeful. Overuse of animations can lead to slower performance, visual fatigue, and accessibility issues. Designers must strike a balance: keep animations brief, subtle, and supportive of tasks. Tools like <em>Google Material Design</em> and Apple’s <em>Human Interface Guidelines</em> offer best practices for timing and behavior of animations to avoid disorientation or delay.</p>

  <p>One real-world application I worked on was a task manager for a local nonprofit. Users reported feeling overwhelmed by the interface, even though it had minimal text. After a UX audit, we added animated transitions to gently slide in and out of task views, fading tooltips, and delayed button feedback to prevent accidental double clicks. These additions didn’t change the underlying functionality—but users described the experience as “clearer” and “more professional.”</p>

  <p>Importantly, motion also plays a role in accessibility. For example, respecting users' "prefers-reduced-motion" settings ensures inclusive design. Not all users want or can tolerate animated transitions. Designers must ensure their products do not create barriers for people with sensory sensitivities or neurological conditions. Good UX is good for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, strong interaction patterns rely on deeply human-centered principles. UX laws like Fitts’s Law and Jakob’s Law guide where and how to place elements for efficiency. Tesler’s Law teaches us to hide complexity when possible. And motion—used wisely—creates continuity, confidence, and delight. By grounding our decisions in psychology and usability research, we ensure our designs are not only beautiful but functional and empathetic.</p>

  <h2>Persuasive Design, Ethics, and Emotional Responsibility</h2>

  <p>Persuasive design is a powerful tool. It can guide users toward healthier habits, increase engagement, and help people achieve goals more easily. However, with that power comes responsibility. Designers must consider the ethical implications of every persuasive element—because while UX can nudge, it can also manipulate. The line between help and coercion is thin, and crossing it can damage both users and brands.</p>

  <p>Consider the concept of “dark patterns,” coined by Harry Brignull. These are deceptive design strategies that trick users into taking actions they didn’t intend—like subscribing to newsletters or unknowingly giving away personal data (Brignull, 2010). Common examples include pre-checked boxes, hidden costs during checkout, and deliberately confusing opt-out links. These tactics may boost short-term conversions, but they erode trust. Ethical design should aim for transparency, clarity, and user control.</p>

  <p>One of the most debated persuasive design techniques is the use of streaks and gamification. Take Duolingo, for example: its daily streak counter motivates users to continue language learning. While this can be positive reinforcement, it can also create anxiety or guilt. In their own UX writing, Duolingo acknowledges this balance and allows users to “freeze” a streak—a small feature with a big impact on mental wellbeing (Duolingo, 2023).</p>

  <p>In a personal project, I designed a mindfulness app targeting university students. Our initial tests used streaks and reminders to boost retention. But users reported feeling pressured—some even said the app made them feel like they were failing if they missed a session. We revised the design to allow more flexible tracking and reframed reminders as “gentle check-ins.” After the redesign, both retention and satisfaction improved. This experience taught me that ethical persuasion must prioritize the user’s emotional state and autonomy.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="images/image.a.jpg"Design ethics concept with positive visual cues">
    <figcaption>Image by Unsplash. Licensed under Unsplash License.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>To navigate ethical challenges, UX professionals can refer to resources like the Nielsen Norman Group’s <em>Ethical Heuristics</em>, which advocate for things like consent, clarity, and reversibility (Nielsen Norman Group, 2023). These heuristics encourage designers to be honest about persuasive intentions and ensure users can make informed choices. For example, confirmation dialogs, undo buttons, and clear explanations empower users rather than deceive them.</p>

  <p>Another core idea comes from Johnson’s (2020) discussion of persuasive technology. He argues that systems should support user agency rather than override it. This means avoiding fear-based triggers, exploiting user insecurities, or leveraging addiction cycles. Instead, persuasive elements should affirm the user’s goals and offer scaffolding to make progress feel achievable.</p>

  <p>Ethical UX also involves emotional responsibility. We design not just screens, but states of mind. A poorly timed notification can interrupt a moment of peace. A misleading progress bar can cause false hope. We must consider emotional outcomes of every feature. Are we building something that uplifts—or undermines—wellbeing?</p>

  <p>In my work with a local nonprofit’s digital fundraising tool, we found that donation forms that used urgency messaging (“Only 1 spot left!”) increased clicks, but led to lower follow-through rates and complaints. After replacing this with a progress bar and transparent impact summaries (“You’re helping fund 3 meals”), donations became more consistent and user trust increased. This showed us that ethical persuasion can still be effective—without resorting to tricks.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, persuasive design must be paired with empathy and integrity. It’s not wrong to nudge users—but they must understand and agree with the direction they’re being nudged. When we design with clarity, consent, and compassion, we create digital spaces that support not just goals, but growth.</p>
