             <h1>Support User Thinking: Why Usability Starts in the Mind</h1>
           </header>
           <article>
             <p>When people interact with a digital system—whether it's an app, a website, or a software platform—they don’t stop and think about all the processes going on in their brain. But behind every tap, swipe, or click is a complex set of mental functions working together to understand, predict, and respond to the system’s behavior. Good design doesn’t just look nice—it supports the way people think. This means that designers have to understand human memory, habits, and the shortcuts our brains take to save time and energy. If the design doesn't support these natural tendencies, it forces users to do more thinking than they should, which results in frustration, confusion, and errors.</p>
         
             <p>One of the most important things to consider when designing for usability is memory. Human memory has its limitations, especially short-term memory, which can only hold a small amount of information at a time. George Miller’s research from the 1950s (Miller, 1956) suggested that people can hold about seven items in their working memory—give or take two. That might not seem like much, but in a digital environment, it matters a lot. Think about when you go to a website and see 12 different menu options or a long form with too many steps. Your brain starts to feel overloaded, and the experience becomes tiring. This is where the idea of cognitive load comes in. If a user has to remember too much or figure out too many things on their own, they become mentally exhausted.</p>
         
             <p>Another way memory plays a role in usability is through what we call mental models. A mental model is a user’s internal idea of how a system is supposed to work. This model is built from past experiences, intuition, and learned behavior. For example, when someone sees a shopping cart icon, they automatically know it’s where their selected items go. Or when they click on a logo in the top-left corner of a page, they expect it to take them back to the homepage. When designers stick to these mental models, users feel comfortable and confident. But when designs break these expectations—for example, placing navigation buttons in random spots or using unclear symbols—users feel confused and lost (Johnson, 2020).</p>

             <p>Consistency is one of the best ways to support both memory and mental models. If users see the same layouts, fonts, icons, and terminology across a system, they don’t have to learn how to use it all over again each time. This reduces cognitive load and makes the system feel more predictable. As Don Norman (2013) explains in The Design of Everyday Things, good design builds trust by being reliable and easy to predict. Most people don’t want to “figure out” how to use something—they want it to just make sense. That’s why most social media apps put the notification bell, settings gear, and profile icon in similar places. When everything looks familiar, the brain can relax.</p>

             <p><em>Figure 2: Familiar UI elements reduce mental strain  (<a href="https://google.com/photos/Bg0Geue-c8Q" target="_blank">source</a>).</em></p>
         
             <p>Feedback is another crucial element of usable design. Every time a user takes an action, they expect some kind of response. Whether it's a subtle vibration, a loading spinner, or a confirmation message, users need to know that the system received their input. Without feedback, they’re left wondering if their action was successful—or if the system is broken. In Designing with the Mind in Mind, Jeff Johnson (2020) emphasizes the importance of perceptual causality: the idea that users need a fast, clear signal that something is happening. For example, if a person taps a “Submit” button and nothing happens, they may tap it again…and again…which can lead to duplicate submissions or errors. I’ve personally experienced this while submitting a university form online. The page didn’t change or give any feedback, so I clicked “Submit” three more times, and the system processed it four times in total! A simple visual cue could have prevented that. </p>
         
             <p>On the flip side, poor design can increase cognitive load unnecessarily. I remember trying to help a friend sign up for financial aid through a government portal. The login page was a mess—the fields were unlabeled, the error messages were vague, and even the “Help” link didn’t provide helpful information. It took multiple attempts and a lot of guessing to finally get it right. The design failed because it didn’t align with the way people think or behave. Instead of helping the user, it forced them to do more mental work. This is a perfect example of what Tesler’s Law warns against. Tesler’s Law states that every system has an inherent level of complexity—someone has to deal with it. If designers don’t handle it, the burden falls on users (Tesler, as cited in Norman, 2013). Good systems hide that complexity through thoughtful design, automation, and sensible defaults.</p>
         
             <p>Let’s look at a real-world example. Many food delivery apps allow users to save their address. Once saved, it becomes the default for future orders. This saves time and reduces friction. Now imagine if every time you placed an order, the app asked you to re-enter your full address from scratch. That’s not just annoying—it’s an example of the system offloading complexity onto the user. By saving that data and applying it automatically, the system does the thinking for the user, following the principle of minimizing user input.</p>
         
             <p>Another principle from Johnson’s book that supports usability is the Principle of Proximity—the idea that elements placed close together are perceived to be related. This is why most websites group navigation buttons together and place form labels next to their input fields. It sounds basic, but it has a huge impact. If the “Delete” and “Save” buttons are far apart, users are less likely to hit the wrong one. But if they’re right next to each other and look the same, mistakes happen. The principle of proximity helps prevent that.</p>
         
             <p>Design also needs to account for how people learn through repetition and habit. Over time, users develop routines for how they use certain systems. If a software update suddenly moves a familiar button to a new location or changes its icon, users will be frustrated—even if the new version is “better.” That’s because habits are hard to break, and change creates a new learning curve. For example, when Instagram moved the post button, many users complained not because the new placement was worse, but because it broke their habits. If users are forced to re-learn things too often, they may stop using the product altogether.</p>
         
             <p>This ties into another powerful concept: heuristics, or mental shortcuts. These are rules of thumb the brain uses to make quick decisions. For example, if something looks like a button, we expect it to be clickable. If it has a drop shadow or changes color when we hover, we assume it can be pressed. These mental shortcuts help us interact with systems quickly and efficiently. But when design ignores or breaks these rules, users get frustrated. For instance, a flat image that looks like a button but doesn’t respond can mislead users and break their trust.</p>
         
             <p>Another great example is the search function on websites. Users expect a magnifying glass icon to represent search. If a designer replaces that icon with something abstract or puts the search bar in an unusual place, users might not find it at all. That’s why conventions exist—they help reduce the amount of thinking users need to do. Following these conventions isn’t lazy—it’s respectful of users’ time and mental energy.</p>
         
             <p>Another often overlooked but vital aspect of supporting user thinking is error prevention and recovery. No matter how intuitive a system is, users will still make mistakes. A well-designed system doesn’t just tell users they made an error—it helps them fix it quickly and painlessly. According to the Nielsen Norman Group (n.d.), effective design includes not only clear error messages but also suggestions for correction.</p>
         
             <img src="mo 2.2 photos/mp 2.2 3.png" alt="User interface showing helpful error message" style="width:100%; margin-top: 20px;">
             <p><em>Figure 3: Helpful feedback builds user trust (<a href="https://google/photos/bcbf1c2c-1b44-40b7-9dd3-cfd928024d83" target="_blank">source</a>).</em></p>

             <p> Design isn’t just about making things look good—it’s about making things work well for the people using them. That includes clear navigation, simple language, readable fonts, and mobile-friendly layouts. When users don’t have to stop and think about how to use a system, they can focus on their goals. When systems support how we think, remember, and behave, we can be more productive and less frustrated.</p>
         
             <p>In conclusion, supporting user thinking means designing with the brain in mind. Usability is about reducing the mental work users have to do. That means designing systems that match users’ mental models, minimizing memory load, providing clear feedback, and following consistent patterns. Good design doesn’t just help people—it respects them. By applying principles like Tesler’s Law, perceptual causality, proximity, and memory limits, we can build systems that are not only functional but truly user-friendly. Whether you're designing a website, an app, or any digital tool, always ask yourself: “Am I making this easier for the user—or harder?” Because the best systems aren’t just usable—they’re invisible.</p>
