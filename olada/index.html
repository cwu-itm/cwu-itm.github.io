            <h3>Systems Thinking and how it Differs from Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>Over the years, there have been significant changes and shifts that have altered our opinions, feelings and perceptions about various aspects of our lives. Similarly, the changing nature of our world and the complex relationships among and between us creates an essential shift in the way that we think about the systems in and around us. This shift is evident in how we approach the design of digital systems. Systems thinking provides us with a "whole" or holistic cognitive approach to understanding how elements within a system relate to each other and how they interact with one another (Arnold & Wade, 2015). Rather than examining individual parts in isolation, systems thinking indicates that we must first understand the interrelationship between the elements of the system such as the organizations and people involved, as well as the dynamic feedback loop between them. By understanding these two factors together, we can develop a clearer understanding of the defining properties and behaviors or emergent properties that the system exhibits (Kim, 1999). We cannot predict how the system will behave simply by analyzing its components. Systems thinking leads us to move from a static or snapshot view of analyzing things to a dynamic view by looking at how the system shifts over time. We acknowledge that the world exists within a series of interconnected cause-and-effect relationships that are typically circular rather than linear.</p>
            <h3>Definition and Concept</h3>
            <p>The concept of systems thinking greatly contrasts with traditional linear logic that has dominated both engineering and management for so long. Linear logic is inherently analytical and reductionist; that is, it breaks down an extremely complex or multilayered issue into smaller parts so you can address them in isolation and reassemble the answers assuming their outcome is only due to the addition of these isolated parts together. Linear logic also follows a single, straight line of causality: if "A" occurs, then "B" will happen. While this method is efficient for simple, clearly defined issues, it becomes incorrect and very dangerous to apply linear logic to the complexity of a complex adaptive system. The most critical aspect of linear logic as it relates to systems thinking is its inherent inadequacy at addressing feedback loops. "B" can also influence the results of "A." The emergence of feedback loops can create a scenario that results in either the growth, collapse, or stability of the system itself. As illustrated by Kim (1999) a manager using linear thinking may consider a sequentially related series of events when looking at the falling sales, the promotion launched and the rising sales. On the other hand, a systems thinker would understand how these three events are connected and could map out the circular feedback between them. For example, although the promotion may generate more sales, it may also generate more backlogs. As a result, customers could become frustrated and eventually stop purchasing products due to their experience with backlogs. As such, promotions could continue to be implemented in this vicious circle. In CapCo (2023), Kahneman defined the linear mindset associated with this way of thinking as "System 2" thinking, which is thinking that is methodical, slow, and deliberate when compared to systems thinking which is based on the observation and experience of developing "System 1" thinking patterns. This means that system thinking would have an advantage over methodical thinking in complex decision-making processes since the decision maker would be able to see the whole picture before they make their final decision.</p>
            <h3>The "3 Evils of Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>Contemporary complex digital systems such as global-scale cloud platforms (GCPs), microservice architectures, and internet of things ecosystems show clearly that linear thinking leads to significant limitations in their development. According to Holt (2022), the "3 Evils of Systems Engineering", including complexity, communication, and understanding, fully define and explain many of the struggles related to digital complexity. Digital complexity can be divided into two categories, including increased volume and the aggregation of multiple digital components. Digital complexity has resulted in the proliferation of the volume of digital components that will generate digital complexity and limitations in the level of communication and understanding of what scalability means to different stakeholders in the digital system. For instance, the difference between what a database engineer thinks scalability is for a digital system will likely be very different from what a product manager thinks. The traditional document centric development magnifies the three evils of systems engineering by creating disjointed documents containing different requirements specifications, architectural diagrams, and testing plans. Because of this, there is a high degree of document inconsistency and manual and makes traceability hard (Holt, 2022). As a result, the true design of the digital system is not easily accessible to developers, operators, or anyone else in that digital system. Instead, they are only available in the collective knowledge of the team or fragmented team knowledge base.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>Due to the significant changes that have been happening in recent years, there will no longer be a need to design various features of a digital product in isolation, and a Model-Based Engineering Approach like the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). The fundamental principle of MBSE is to create an integrated model of a system that serves as a central source of truth for that system. As Holt (2022) explains, “In the case of MBSE, all of the knowledge concerning the System resides in the Model that abstracts the System:” (p. 33). An MBSE model is not simply a collection of images. It is a semantically rich repository of information that describes the System’s structure, behavior, requirements, and constraints. The MBSE method produces the greatest benefits by separating the model from its views. This means that the underlying model remains stable, consistent, and accurate while a wide variety of views such as diagrams, tables, and documents, can be produced as needed for each stakeholder. For example, a security architect may create a view that illustrates the data flowing between systems, while a DevOps engineer may create a deployment view illustrating the required resources for deploying individual components. Both views will be created from a common, shared basis of reality and will therefore not contain any of the inconsistencies that can occur in document-centric designs.</p>
            <h3>Relevance of Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>In essence, the MBSE's relevance to digital systems is evident in its ability to manage the inherent complexity of systems with an abstraction model in conjunction with a relationship management model. One of the greatest challenges with implementing a digital platform that contains hundreds of services is understanding how changes to one service affect all other services, particularly when the changes occur through an API contract. Due to the complexity involved with identifying all affected components and systems, MBSE provides a way to explicitly define these dependencies in its models. Additionally, traceability of components to regulatory requirements is not just a wishful based initiative but rather part of the MBSE model itself, allowing for engineers to quickly access information to make informed decisions based on real-time data regarding changes to regulatory compliance. By making these relationships explicit, MBSE can effectively change the way governance and change management are performed, moving them from an imprecise and often risky guesswork approach to a more systematic, analytical method. In addition, MBSE addresses the issue of communication across disciplines by promoting the use of SysML as a common language and requiring that organizations create a project or organizational ontology. The ontology provides definitions of a specific domain language, including what constitutes a service, a user session, or a failure domain, thereby providing the necessary common terminology to facilitate effective communication among all relevant parties.</p>
            <h3>Evolution of Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>As companies move from traditional analog systems to fully automated digital products, the shift toward a model-based paradigm is very similar to how current digital product teams are evolving. The evolution of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) through various stages of development is closely related to how companies went from doing things on an "as needed" basis through the use of code and infrastructure as code, including DevOps and GitOps to full implementation of an MBSE model (Holt, 2022). By utilizing an MBSE model, companies can create a constantly updated model of their entire software system, allowing them to run simulations off of their architectural models before writing the code for their product. Full MBSE is an example of combining the thought processes of systems thinking with agile execution to ensure the "smarter mistakes" concept (CapCo, 2023). Through using the iterative cycle of rapid experimentation and learning from failures, a company can incorporate lessons learned in developing its products into its ongoing digital product development process. Each experiment will produce a "hypothesis" that can then be tested to create a better understanding of the company's digital ecosystem within the company's entire ecosystem and produce a cycle of better learning and improved adaptability.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, combining systems thinking with a model-based approach creates a solid foundation for transitioning from working in complex digital systems to working on complex digital systems effectively. Teams move from operators of separate components to designers and maintainers of unified and adaptable systems. The linear thinker would see only that a particular server requires an upgrade; however, the systems thinker with a model will view this as a node among many nodes dependent on one another and recognize how that server's upgrade impacts latency, cost, security posture, and user experience throughout the entire ecosystem of interconnected digital systems. As we live in a time of increasing interdependence and emergence, increasing the ability of practitioners to use systems thinking and model-based systems engineering are no longer just good to have for specialty engineering projects. This is a core competency necessary to ensure the ongoing design of complex digital systems, which increasingly support modern society, with regard to resilience, adaptability, and sustainability in an ever-evolving environment.</p>
