            <h3>Systems Thinking and how it Differs from Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>Over the years, there have been significant changes and shifts that have altered our opinions, feelings and perceptions about various aspects of our lives. Similarly, the changing nature of our world and the complex relationships among and between us creates an essential shift in the way that we think about the systems in and around us. This shift is evident in how we approach the design of digital systems. Systems thinking provides us with a "whole" or holistic cognitive approach to understanding how elements within a system relate to each other and how they interact with one another (Arnold & Wade, 2015). Rather than examining individual parts in isolation, systems thinking indicates that we must first understand the interrelationship between the elements of the system such as the organizations and people involved, as well as the dynamic feedback loop between them. By understanding these two factors together, we can develop a clearer understanding of the defining properties and behaviors or emergent properties that the system exhibits (Kim, 1999). We cannot predict how the system will behave simply by analyzing its components. Systems thinking leads us to move from a static or snapshot view of analyzing things to a dynamic view by looking at how the system shifts over time. We acknowledge that the world exists within a series of interconnected cause-and-effect relationships that are typically circular rather than linear.</p>
            <h3>Definition and Concept</h3>
            <p>The concept of systems thinking greatly contrasts with traditional linear logic that has dominated both engineering and management for so long. Linear logic is inherently analytical and reductionist; that is, it breaks down an extremely complex or multilayered issue into smaller parts so you can address them in isolation and reassemble the answers assuming their outcome is only due to the addition of these isolated parts together. Linear logic also follows a single, straight line of causality: if "A" occurs, then "B" will happen. While this method is efficient for simple, clearly defined issues, it becomes incorrect and very dangerous to apply linear logic to the complexity of a complex adaptive system. The most critical aspect of linear logic as it relates to systems thinking is its inherent inadequacy at addressing feedback loops. "B" can also influence the results of "A." The emergence of feedback loops can create a scenario that results in either the growth, collapse, or stability of the system itself. As illustrated by Kim (1999) a manager using linear thinking may consider a sequentially related series of events when looking at the falling sales, the promotion launched and the rising sales. On the other hand, a systems thinker would understand how these three events are connected and could map out the circular feedback between them. For example, although the promotion may generate more sales, it may also generate more backlogs. As a result, customers could become frustrated and eventually stop purchasing products due to their experience with backlogs. As such, promotions could continue to be implemented in this vicious circle. In CapCo (2023), Kahneman defined the linear mindset associated with this way of thinking as "System 2" thinking, which is thinking that is methodical, slow, and deliberate when compared to systems thinking which is based on the observation and experience of developing "System 1" thinking patterns. This means that system thinking would have an advantage over methodical thinking in complex decision-making processes since the decision maker would be able to see the whole picture before they make their final decision.</p>
            <h3>The "3 Evils of Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>Contemporary complex digital systems such as global-scale cloud platforms (GCPs), microservice architectures, and internet of things ecosystems show clearly that linear thinking leads to significant limitations in their development. According to Holt (2022), the "3 Evils of Systems Engineering", including complexity, communication, and understanding, fully define and explain many of the struggles related to digital complexity. Digital complexity can be divided into two categories, including increased volume and the aggregation of multiple digital components. Digital complexity has resulted in the proliferation of the volume of digital components that will generate digital complexity and limitations in the level of communication and understanding of what scalability means to different stakeholders in the digital system. For instance, the difference between what a database engineer thinks scalability is for a digital system will likely be very different from what a product manager thinks. The traditional document centric development magnifies the three evils of systems engineering by creating disjointed documents containing different requirements specifications, architectural diagrams, and testing plans. Because of this, there is a high degree of document inconsistency and manual and makes traceability hard (Holt, 2022). As a result, the true design of the digital system is not easily accessible to developers, operators, or anyone else in that digital system. Instead, they are only available in the collective knowledge of the team or fragmented team knowledge base.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>Due to the significant changes that have been happening in recent years, there will no longer be a need to design various features of a digital product in isolation, and a Model-Based Engineering Approach like the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). The fundamental principle of MBSE is to create an integrated model of a system that serves as a central source of truth for that system. As Holt (2022) explains, “In the case of MBSE, all of the knowledge concerning the System resides in the Model that abstracts the System:” (p. 33). An MBSE model is not simply a collection of images. It is a semantically rich repository of information that describes the System’s structure, behavior, requirements, and constraints. The MBSE method produces the greatest benefits by separating the model from its views. This means that the underlying model remains stable, consistent, and accurate while a wide variety of views such as diagrams, tables, and documents, can be produced as needed for each stakeholder. For example, a security architect may create a view that illustrates the data flowing between systems, while a DevOps engineer may create a deployment view illustrating the required resources for deploying individual components. Both views will be created from a common, shared basis of reality and will therefore not contain any of the inconsistencies that can occur in document-centric designs.</p>
            <h3>Relevance of Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>In essence, the MBSE's relevance to digital systems is evident in its ability to manage the inherent complexity of systems with an abstraction model in conjunction with a relationship management model. One of the greatest challenges with implementing a digital platform that contains hundreds of services is understanding how changes to one service affect all other services, particularly when the changes occur through an API contract. Due to the complexity involved with identifying all affected components and systems, MBSE provides a way to explicitly define these dependencies in its models. Additionally, traceability of components to regulatory requirements is not just a wishful based initiative but rather part of the MBSE model itself, allowing for engineers to quickly access information to make informed decisions based on real-time data regarding changes to regulatory compliance. By making these relationships explicit, MBSE can effectively change the way governance and change management are performed, moving them from an imprecise and often risky guesswork approach to a more systematic, analytical method. In addition, MBSE addresses the issue of communication across disciplines by promoting the use of SysML as a common language and requiring that organizations create a project or organizational ontology. The ontology provides definitions of a specific domain language, including what constitutes a service, a user session, or a failure domain, thereby providing the necessary common terminology to facilitate effective communication among all relevant parties.</p>
            <h3>Evolution of Model-Based Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>As companies move from traditional analog systems to fully automated digital products, the shift toward a model-based paradigm is very similar to how current digital product teams are evolving. The evolution of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) through various stages of development is closely related to how companies went from doing things on an "as needed" basis through the use of code and infrastructure as code, including DevOps and GitOps to full implementation of an MBSE model (Holt, 2022). By utilizing an MBSE model, companies can create a constantly updated model of their entire software system, allowing them to run simulations off of their architectural models before writing the code for their product. Full MBSE is an example of combining the thought processes of systems thinking with agile execution to ensure the "smarter mistakes" concept (CapCo, 2023). Through using the iterative cycle of rapid experimentation and learning from failures, a company can incorporate lessons learned in developing its products into its ongoing digital product development process. Each experiment will produce a "hypothesis" that can then be tested to create a better understanding of the company's digital ecosystem within the company's entire ecosystem and produce a cycle of better learning and improved adaptability.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, combining systems thinking with a model-based approach creates a solid foundation for transitioning from working in complex digital systems to working on complex digital systems effectively. Teams move from operators of separate components to designers and maintainers of unified and adaptable systems. The linear thinker would see only that a particular server requires an upgrade; however, the systems thinker with a model will view this as a node among many nodes dependent on one another and recognize how that server's upgrade impacts latency, cost, security posture, and user experience throughout the entire ecosystem of interconnected digital systems. As we live in a time of increasing interdependence and emergence, increasing the ability of practitioners to use systems thinking and model-based systems engineering are no longer just good to have for specialty engineering projects. This is a core competency necessary to ensure the ongoing design of complex digital systems, which increasingly support modern society, with regard to resilience, adaptability, and sustainability in an ever-evolving environment.</p>

            <h3>Thinking in Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>Systems engineers are not just system builders, they also function as stewards of systems throughout their entire lifecycle, from conceptualization to end of life. Therefore, the role of system engineers in the creation of systems is just one step in an extensive journey through the life cycle. The systems development life cycle (SDLC) model allows systems engineers to view all stages, processes, and decisions based on a constructs model viewed as a single cycle of a product's life. The SDLC is a structured process of creating and sustaining reliable, sustainable, and adaptive systems. The study of an organization's SDLC and its models is essential for all individuals involved in the creation of digital systems that will last, be flexible, and deliver an ongoing return on investment. This blog post will explain the nature of the SDLC, develop a description of the three major SDLC models (linear, iterative, and incremental) and summarize the significance of a lifecycle viewpoint in the design and development of modern digital systems.</p>
            <h3>Defining the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h3>
            <p>The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a model that describes the entire life cycle of a system or product from start to finish. In general, the SDLC provides structuring, control, and visibility to what would otherwise be a complex and risky process and ensures that the key steps have not been omitted. It also provides natural review and decision-making milestones and establishes a common language and framework for all project stakeholders, including engineers, developers, managers, and customers. The SDLC is broken down into phases, including conception, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement (Holt, 2023).  It is a structure for the evolution of an entity, where the entity is the actual system, and the SDLC provides the framework for this evolution.</p>
            <h3>Phases of the Systems Development Life Cycle</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>Conception: This is the initial stage of the development lifecycle is the conception phase which focuses on determining if there is an unmet need or an opportunity within the business environment that could be addressed. Feasibility studies will be undertaken to determine if the system can be developed and assigned stakeholders will start to be identified as well. The overall scope of the project and what the goals of the system are will also be developed during this phase. The key question to be answered is: "Should we do this? Why?"</li>
               <li>Development: In this phase, a potential solution for the problem or need identified in the conception stage is sought. The focus for this phase is defining what the system must be capable of doing and how the system should be designed to allow for this capability.</li>
               <li>Production: This is the process of creating a system. A system's components are created, integrated, and evaluated based on the designs and requirements of the system. The creation of a system changes a model or plan into an actual working product.</li>
               <li>Utilization: This phase defines what the system will be used for and what happens during use. It is also involves training the stakeholders on ho to use the system effectively.</li>
               <li>Support: This phase provides support to the system. It may include fixing defects, applying software updates, enhancing performance, and making minor changes to meet changing technology and user needs.</li>
               <li>Retirement: Eventually, all systems will become obsolete or no longer be feasible. Therefore, a final phase is required to provide for safe, orderly decommissioning, data archival or migration, as well as the disposal or recycling process. This is the retirement phase.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Life Cycle Models</h3>
            <h3>The Linear Model</h3>
            <p>Linear Model is also known as the Waterfall Model. As indicated by Winston Royce in 1970, it involves creating a flowing graphical representation of the SDLC as a series of downward phases (Holt, 2023). The SDLC is best depicted by using the term "Waterfall" because of its cascading effect, with all deliverables being developed in succession (Gurung et al., 2020). This means that once a phase is completed, you cannot go back to it unless you restart all of the phases you have done thus far; this effectively prohibits you from going back to any previous phases.</p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>The flow of Development is linear from the initial idea through conception through completion. Similar to falling water, as the product moves downward through the development stage, through completion, and through maintenance.</li>
               <li>The Waterfall technique requires extensive documentation from every phase of the SDLC. Each phase creates its own documentation that is used as input for the subsequent phase and cannot be changed.</li>
               <li>The scope of the entire system is determined in advance, if any changes are needed to the specifications or requirements after development has begun, they are generally discouraged.</li>
               <li>System testing typically occurs only after all development work has been completed on the entire system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <p>A linear life cycle model is advantageous because it is organized and structured in such a way that it provides clarity. The primary advantage to the linear life cycle model is that the resources, like information regarding milestones, schedule, and budget, are available at the beginning of each project. A discipline and documentation system can help provide structure and organization for project management, which is particularly true in regulated industries like vendor contracts and medical devices. Additionally, the linear model tends to be the most appropriate for projects where the requirements are clearly defined and remain stable throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>On the other hand, the model has several drawbacks. For instance, the linear life cycle model has little flexibility, which is a significant weakness. This means that it is not an appropriate approach for large, complex projects and systems where requirements may be dynamic or the problem or need might be prone to changes (Holt, 2023). This is because when late-discovered requirements or late-discovered errors occur, they can cause severe delays and costs associated with fixing them. Secondly, the client or user does not see a working product until very late in the process, which puts the them at increased risk of having something built that does not meet their actual needs. Lastly, because testing is postponed until the project nears completion, there is a high risk of having significant major design or integration flaws that may remain undetected until the very end of the project.</p>
            <h3>The Iterative Model</h3>
            <p>The Iterative model was developed as a response to the linear model’s inflexibility. Rather than having one long linear process throughout the SDLC stages, the iterative model provides for the breakdown of a system development project into small repeated cycles of development called iterations (Gurung et al., 2020). Each iteration is its own mini-project that goes through a truncated version of all SDLC phases, delivering a functional but incomplete version of the system.</p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>The development project progresses through a series of iterations such as time-boxed sprints of 2-4 weeks.</li>
               <li>The system continues to build on the most current iteration providing for incremental improvements and development of functionality. This means that the system will continue to evolve as the project develops.</li>
               <li>Stakeholders provide continuous feedback on the functional output of each iteration, which helps to modify the priorities and plans for the next iteration.</li>
               <li>Developers can take a bigger risk in tackling items that may be considered as risks, like new technology or core architecture, by producing a functional version of their solution during the earlier iterations for both validations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <p>One of the advantages of using the iterative model is that it is very flexible, meaning that any new requirements can be added into the next iteration. More so, its ability to quickly deliver a working system helps identify and mitigate both technical risk and miscommunication about the requirements at an earlier stage. Furthermore, feedback loops help keep all stakeholders involved in the product development process to ensure that the final product is as close as possible to what they needed. Lastly, the iterative model allows the engineers to break the system down into smaller iterations rather than managing one large project, which provides much less complexity and, therefore, more opportunities to adapt the project as needed in route.</p>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>However, the iterative model has no defined scope. Without clearly defined scope boundaries, there is room for continued influx of new ideas and features, which increases the scope of the project. Since the metrics of each iteration must be tracked, it is harder to compare initial fixed project scope with progress made. Lastly, compared to Waterfall model, the final project delivery date and estimated cost can be more challenging to determine during the early stages of development due to the iterative nature of this model. These are the major disadvantages of the iterative model.</p>
            <h3>The Incremental Model</h3>
            <p>The Incremental model involves the delivery of increments of functionality to clients during production. An increment is defined as an entire functional unit that provides value independently from other functional units (Holt, 2023). This model is similar but also different from the iterative model.</p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Delivery occurs in phases, rather than a final product</li>
               <li>Development of increments occurs in a linear manner</li>
               <li>Production of multiple increments at the same time</li>
               <li>Delivery of value in order of importance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <p>One advantage of using the incremental model is that the users can begin using important parts of the system long before it is completed. By delivering useful functionality that the users can benefit from in the form of completed increments, the model allows users to utilize these services much more quickly than with other approaches such as Waterfall. More so, because the incremental pieces are small enough to be managed, it lowers the risk associated with trying to deliver a large system solution. Lastly, testing smaller increments during the integration process is typically easier than integrating an entire system.</p>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>While the incremental model offers some benefits, there are also downsides associated with this technique that must be considered. The primary limitation is that in order to create a clear increment in the overall design of a product, you must first identify how to partition the value of the product into clear increments. When developing highly integrated products this is not always an easy task, as it may not be possible to separate out the value of components into distinct increments. The second limitation to using this method is that before being able to effectively develop partitions of the total value, you will be required to spend a considerable amount of time developing a robust architecture or design of the complete system along with a clear understanding of each individual increment of value. If the individual increments are not accurately defined in relation to their relationship to each other, the combination of aggregated increments will not constitute an effectively designed product or system.</p>
            <h3>Importance of Life Cycle Thinking</h3>
            <p>In order to evolve with time and sustain a digital system throughout its life cycle, you need a systems lifecycle perspective on all phases of that digital system, from its conception to retirement. Thinking about a digital system as having modular and maintainable components allows us to create digital systems as durable and serviceable, not just launch-ready. By using a systems perspective and thinking about the lifecycle of a digital system throughout the design process, we can determine at the outset whether or not the system will be scalable, secure, and adaptable for the future, resulting in resilient digital systems that can adapt to changing demands over their lifetimes. Sustainability is also directly related to a systems lifecycle perspective in that most of the costs and resources of a digital system occur in the operational and maintenance phases of a digital system (Maciel et al., 2024). Therefore, if from the day we build a digital system, we include in our design the necessary provisions for ongoing support and upgrades and an overall plan for managing any technical debt, then our digital systems will remain secure, viable, and cost effective from the date we built them until the date they are retired. In contrast to being a legacy burden that we have to deal with in the future, our digital systems will continue to deliver value through ongoing productivity, revenue generation, maintenance and improvement.</p>
            <p>In addition, technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, so systems need to be able to adapt to that change on an ongoing basis. The most effective way to build a mechanism for ongoing system development and improvement is to utilize iterative or incremental models in the creation of that system. This means enabling system creators to build systems that support changing user requirements and enable the integration of new technologies. By enabling system creators to use cyclical methodologies, system creators can avoid significant and expensive redesigns due to changing user requirements and changing market conditions. The key drivers of a holistic perspective on the system and an end-to-end method of creating digital systems are total ownership, risk mitigation, and stakeholder alignment. By taking a holistic perspective on the system and using an end-to-end methodology, digital systems can be created as assets with ongoing value and ongoing opportunities for innovation and continued evolution.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In essence, the Systems Development Life Cycle is not simply a series of steps to be followed. It is a process that establishes the foundation for what must happen for effective systems engineering to be successful. It defines how to choose between linear, iterative and incremental models and how to determine a fundamental strategic decision to create alignment between the project and the type of environment, as well as the level of stability required. Due to the high level of digital transformation currently, systems are now expected to be resilient, adaptable, and sustainable. Therefore, the use of life cycle thinking is now essential during development. This is because it allows us to shift our roles from a short-term builder to a long-term steward of the digital ecosystem for the world we create. By being intentional in the way we design, build and maintain systems for all phases of their life cycle, we will allow them to provide us with not only immediate function, but also the ability to provide long-term value and future Innovation through the opportunities they will create.</p>

            <h3>Designing for People</h3>
            <p>Designing for people involves understanding that each user has a unique set of experiences, biases, capabilities, and limitations that they bring to using our products. When designing for people, developers must recognize that designs intersect with people in their lives both practically and emotionally, they are not just sitting by themselves, they are part of a much larger picture of human life. Human-centered design (HCD) marks a huge shift in how UX designers think about solving problems. Instead of thinking about technology capabilities or business requirements first when designing solutions to solve their problems, they think about people first, their needs, patterns of behavior, and context. The IDEO’s Field Guide captures this new way of approaching problem-solving when they state that embracing human-centered design means that all problems no matter how difficult they seem are solvable. This optimistic starting point is very important, but it is only the beginning. In order to truly embrace and use human-centered design, designers need to also be aware of how they will actually design something based on how they want people to use it from the various psychological and perceptual views through which they will experience the finished product. This blog post will examine how our minds perceive and process information in predictable (perception) and how empathy has become a real design tool. It will also compare how frameworks like ISO 9241-210 and IDEO's Field Guide provide complementary approaches to designing for people. Moreover, the post will examine the four design principles, including Jakob's, Fitts's, Hick's, and Miller's and how they serve as bridges between human psychology and practical design decisions. It will also illustrate how these psychological principles influence design decisions in practice.</p>
            <h3>Comparing ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide</h3>
            <p>The human-centered design (HCD) presents a way to create products and services that actually meet the needs of human beings. However, within the area of HCD there are two important paradigmatic approaches to achieving these goals of product and service creation, the ISO 9241-210 and the IDEO Field Guide. While the ISO-210 is a form based and process-driven model, the IDEO Field Guide is a flexible and mindset-oriented creative model. Both frameworks represent the duality of design as disciplined science and empathetic art.</p>
               <h4>The ISO 9241-210</h4>
            <p>The ISO 9241-210 is a methodical, six-stage process to achieve usability and user satisfaction through a methodical approach. The six stages are planning, context of use, specification of needs, design, evaluation and implementation (NIST, 2021). Each stage is clearly defined in a continuous cycle of iteration and evaluation and is very beneficial to regulated industries such as healthcare and aviation because of the need for accountability and traceability. The standard places importance on documentation and validation. One approach to documentation is requiring designers to create 'context of use' descriptions, as well as establishing formal user requirements, in order for the design decisions to be made based on data rather than gut feel (NIST,2021). Evaluation is not only the end of a project, but an ongoing process of continually evaluating the designs against user requirements and making incremental improvements through iterative design. This methodical approach is consistent with Miller's Law, which discusses human memory limitations, where individuals can retain and manipulate 7 plus or minus 2 items (Yablonski, 2024). By requiring documentation and a structured process for evaluating documents, ISO help to control cognitive overload for both the designer and the user. An organized requirements document allows for the breakdown of complex systems into smaller pieces; similarly, well-designed interfaces can process and reduce the amount of information in order to facilitate the user's understanding of that information. In essence, this design framework places great emphasis on the requirement to actively include users throughout the entire design cycle from initial research through to iterative testing. This provides a structured and repeatable process for the formal capture, validation, and resolution of user needs as they occur.</p>
               <h4>The IDEO’s Field Guide</h4>
            <p>On the other hand, the IDEO's Field Guide gives precedence to mindsets. This means that while an ambitious interpretation of HCD would make it a strictly linear process, IDEO presents it as a journey through creativity that is based on seven core attributes, including empathy, optimism, iteration, creative confidence, making, embracing ambiguity and learning from mistakes (IDEO Design Thinking, 2025). IDEO's three-phase model of inspiration, ideation and implementation is fluid and non-linear so designers can go back and forth as they learn new information. The Field Guide regards empathy as a tool that can be put to practical use to enable designers to “step into other people's shoes". It encourages designers to work with users during the entire process. The Field Guide values ambiguity and prototyping, suggesting to teams that the best way to make it is to actually make a physical manifestation of the idea, as doing so provides the greatest amount of knowledge about that idea. This aspect of IDEO's philosophy, which encourages action and the acceptance of failures, provides ample opportunity for innovation, although it can sometimes appear unstructured to people who have become accustomed to highly structured processes. The IDEO's methodology naturally supports Jakob's Law, which argues that users prefer interfaces that conform to their existing mental models (Yablonski, 2024). This is because IDEO's empathy-based methodology provides designers with the ability to better understand their users' lives and conditions, thereby producing designs that are familiar and will result in intuitive use. For example, when designing a mobile banking app designed for seniors, IDEO's use of empathy will allow designers to better understand what seniors expect, thereby providing the basis for designers to use expected patterns of use instead of novel interaction when making design decisions.</p>
            <h3>Visual Perception and Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>When designing interfaces, both the ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide methods must incorporate human perception and processing of visual information. A user's impression of an interface will create an inherent expectation before they ever see it. According to Johnson (2020), our visual system is not simply a camera capturing images, but is rather a biased system created through experience, context and goal orientation. Utilizing Gestalt principles in design can greatly assist in understanding why some layouts are more intuitive than others, while others appear chaotic. Proximity, for example, groups together control that are related, which reduces cognitive effort when users scan through them (Johnson,2020). When designers do not make use of these principles, users will have to do much more work to understand what the information is telling them. Therefore, an effective visual hierarchy, which refers to how elements are organized based on their relative importance, has a direct impact on usability.</p>
            <p>A defined visual hierarchy will direct users' focus, lessen their cognitive load and assist them in reaching their goals more effectively than if there had been no defined hierarchy. Let us take an airline reservation form, or example. If the design of the form is poorly designed, all of the fields might be displayed in one densely arranged block of text, which would violate Miller's Law by overloading the working memory of the user.  However, if the design of the form were to use segmentation to create logical groupings in the form, including the traveler's information, payment information, and review of the reservation with descriptive headings for each group, the form would be visually appealing and adhere to Hick's Law by eliminating the perception of clinical complexity. This will also reduce the amount of time it takes to make a decision. Fitts's Law states that the time it takes to obtain a target is determined by the size and distance of the target (Yablonski, 2024). Therefore, placing buttons near each other and large enough to be easily manipulated will facilitate interaction with those buttons. The evaluation stage of the ISO will provide a means to determine if the buttons are sized and placed correctly, and also the prototyping method that IDEO uses to allow for an expeditious confirmation process to uncover any problems by physically testing solutions.</p>
            <h3>UX Laws as the Bridging Gaps between ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide.</h3>
            <p>Generally, understanding the feelings and perception of users and applying it to interaction are two different things. Therefore, designers need a way to connect the ISO and IDEO through practical means. This can be done using the four foundational UX laws. For instance:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Jakob's Law states that if a user is familiar with something, they will be able to successfully use it (Yablonski, 2024). When applying ISO standards, user satisfaction can be tested by performing user testing to validate whether users' interface interactions aligned with their expectations. Conversely, IDEO would test user expectations by utilizing an empathetic immersion process to determine users' expectations of an interface.</li>
               <li>Fitt's Law is about physical interaction (Yablonski, 2024). For ISO, you would have to specify minimum touch target sizes in specifications, whereas for IDEO, you would need to build prototypes and closely observe user challenges associated with using small buttons.</li>
               <li>Hick's Law pertains to the complexity of making a decision (Yablonski, 2024). ISO's evaluation may adhere to Hick's Law by measuring user task completion times based on the structure of the user's menu system. IDEO may create different navigation concepts during the ideation phase of a project in order to test multiple potential navigation systems.</li>
               <li>Miller's Law outlines cognitive limitations (Yablonski, 2024). In terms of ISO, they will ensure that when writing specifications, all information must be chunked together so that the information to be remembered is coherent. In terms of IDEO, they will use card sorting techniques to ascertain how users naturally group information.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Balancing ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide</h3>
            <p>In order for designers to implement these two approaches effectively, the teams must combine them together by:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Using IDEO's mindsets to document decisions made during the discovery process and why those decisions were made</li>
               <li>Applying ISO's formal structure for developing the prototype and analyzing it</li>
               <li>Using rapid prototyping (IDEO) and methodical evaluation (ISO)</li>
               <li>Creating a record of your decisions (ISO) while maintaining empathy with your users (IDEO)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All in all, there is a great deal that can be said about the interaction between ISO 9241-210 and IDEO's Field Guide as complementary perspectives rather than opposing philosophies. While the ISO provides a structured approach or discipline, focused on thoroughness, safety and scalability, the IDEO encourages creativity or inspiration and focuses on innovation, empathy, and adaptability. However, the principles and laws associated with either organization are meaningless without the ability to create solutions based on empathy. Empathy is what allows us to go beyond designing interfaces to designing experiences. Empathy requires more than just making assumptions about someone else's experience, it requires the designers to engage users in their context, listen to their story, and work with them to co-create prototypes in order for you to design with empathy. This means that the solutions created will not only be functional but meaningful.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, designing with people both humbling, empowering, and opportunistic. It is humbling because we have to accept that we do not and will never know everything about the people we are designing for. It is empowering because we are at the center of it and we are responsible for developing solutions that will make a difference in huma experience. Lastly, it is an opportunity because by understanding the way the users will take or respond to the experience, it can give a solution that will provide real value to them. The frameworks, principles, and laws discussed throughout the blog can help guide designers, so they can develop the best possible designs, which focus on the user’s needs. The philosophies of design that are defined by ISO 9241-210 are essential guidelines that help to ensure that designers do not miss vital components of the process. IDEO's philosophy is a foundation to help ensure that the user has a true connection with the design and helps developers create designs that are not sterile. On the other hand, the User Experience laws that provide designers with a way to use the information they have learned through their experience to create an interface that works for the user and that provides the user with the right experience. This proves that designing with people in mind is about how you create every interaction, every pixel, and every interaction in relation to how users will experience the design. It is also about creating an interface that is more than just usable. It is about creating a design that has an impact on the user and remembering that every statistic or user group statistic is made up of people with emotion, frustration, limits, and ability. Finally, it is about building a strong belief that every difficult design issue can be solved through design, even the most difficult issues.</p>
