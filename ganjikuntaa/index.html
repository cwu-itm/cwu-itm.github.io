            <h3>What Systems thinking means to me</h3>
            <p>Before I read through a few sources, systems thinking to me just meant a collection of parts working together just as how I see any other physical system in the world. If something breaks, then you fix it and move on. This mindset of thinking does work but only with simple tools, when it comes to larger digital systems it isn’t as simple as this. Systems thinking feels less like repairing parts and more about understanding relationships between different aspects. Instead of seeing why something is failing it’s important to see what interactions led to this problem. Systems thinking is the mindset of seeing any product, organization, or digital environment as more of a network of connected elements that usually influence each other over time. Instead of just isolating problems it forces you to look at patterns, feedback loops, delays, and unintentional consequences. It’s more focused on the structure of the elements instead of the detail. Holt (2019) describes systems thinking as recognizing that systems behave differently than their individual components would make you think. This is important because when you change one part of the system it affects the others which can lead to unexpected results from a single change. For example, a bug fix or a feature update could solve one issue in one section but create three more issues in another section.</p>
            <h3>How Systems Thinking is Different from Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>Linear thinking is usually when you see things in the form of steps. Like if you do A, B, and C then you expect an outcome of D. This way of thinking assumes that causes and effects are completely predictable and direct. In the real world and especially in more software focused ecosystems this would not work since things do not work that way. Linear thinking works well for tasks like following a recipe or assembling furniture. However digital systems aren’t recipes they are closer to an ecosystem. A small change of code in one microservice could affect dozens of dependent services which could change performance, change security exposure, or affect user experience all at once. Meadows (2008) explains that linear thinking makes us treat problems as static, but systems are dynamic. They evolve, respond, and learn. A system that works perfectly today could fail tomorrow because of a new workload, new users, or new constraints. For example, when a company introduces a new feature that’s meant to improve user engagement, the linear expectation here is that the engagement increases. The way systems thinking approaches this is they see that it might increase server loads, introduce new attack opportunities, frustrate power users, or even reduce performance for people on certain devices. These sort of effects aren’t that obvious to most people unless you have trained yourself to look for the interactions instead of the outcomes. </p>
            <h3>Why Digital Systems Demand Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>Our modern digital systems don’t require systems thinking just because they’re big, it’s also the fact that they are interdependent. API’s talk to databases which gives information to analytics platforms, which drive machine learning models, which influence what business decisions are made. No part really exists alone or isolated from everything else. INCOSE (2022) says that complexity grows not from size but from connectivity. The more connected a system becomes the more unpredictable it is. This unpredictability is what can cause outages, data leaks, or some sort of system failure. This is why systems thinking isn’t really optional within the Information Technology industry anymore. It’s part of the base knowledge needed to succeed. Without it engineers can build solutions that are optimized locally but would be globally broken. You might improve one metric which sneakily destroys another more important one. </p>
            <h3>What Model-Based Systems Engineering Adds</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking changes more of how you see the problem. Model-Based Systems Engineering changes how you design the solution. MBSE replaces static documentation with living models that show requirements, behavior, structure, and constraints in a more formal way. Instead of writing long Word documents that take a long time to read, these engineers build interconnected diagrams that update automatically as the system evolves. (Holt, 2019) The real power of MBSE isn’t for the convenience it’s the alignment of everything. Every requirement is connected to a design element, every design element is connected to a test case. When something changes the model shows the ripple effect immediately. </p>
            <h3>Why Traditional Documentation Fails at Scale</h3>
            <p>In traditional development environments documentation is more fragmented. One team writes requirements while another designs the system. Another person tests it. Over time these documents end up drifting apart. This means the system changes but the documentation doesn’t. This leads to situations where nobody fully understands the system anymore. New engineers usually kind of go off instinct or more tribal knowledge. Bugs get fixed by habit instead of insight. MBSE gets rid of this problem by making the model the single source of truth. According to INCOSE (2022), organizations using MBSE report fewer integration errors, better risk management, and faster onboarding for new engineers. That is not because MBSE makes people smarter it just makes the complexity more visible. </p>
            <h3>MBSE as a Tool for Thinking, Not Just Designing</h3>
            <p>One of the most important things I learned from this reading is that MBSE is not just a technical framework its also a thinking framework. It forces you to think in relationships not in features. Instead of wondering how we are supposed to build a model it’s more what role does this module play in the system. You stop optimizing for speed alone and start optimizing for resilience and more long term sustainability overall.</p>
            <h3>Why MBSE Fits Modern Digital Environments</h3>
            <p>Digital environments change constantly such as new technology that gets created, security threats that evolve, and user expectations that change. MBSE gives you a way to adapt without losing control of the system. Meadows (2008) says that systems fail most often when designers misunderstand leverage points which are the small changes that can have a big effect. MBSE emphasizes these leverage points by showing how tight knit parts of the system are. This matters especially in cloud based architectures where services auto scale and communicate and evolve independently. Without a model no one can reliably predict how the system will act under stress.</p>
            <h3>What this means for me as a student</h3>
            <p>Before this assignment I thought systems engineering was mostly about the process but now I know it’s also about the mindset. Systems thinking isn’t really just limited to the office or work environment, I realized I can use it in my daily life and actually use it as an advantage. It has made me more aware of being careful with quick fixes and more curious about the system part of it, like what is the root cause. Instead of asking why something is broken I would ask what relationships made it break. MBSE is basically that mindset put into a physical form that allows you to take action on it. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking is centered around seeing beyond just seeing the parts and actually looking at patterns. It doesn’t allow you to think in assumptions but actually observe and confront the reality of the complexity. MBSE gives us the structure to use that understanding in the real world. Together they are the foundation of systems engineering. Without them digital systems grow faster than our ability to control them. With them we can design environments that can evolve without collapsing or having issues.</p3>
