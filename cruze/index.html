            <h3>Understanding the Lifecycle of Systems Engineering</h3>
            <p>Try to imagine a group of developers creating a new storefront through an app, they are eager to put their ideas into effect and get straight to building their app without a clear plan in mind. The app looks to be successful at first, but over time, its flaws begin to show themselves. Bugs begin to surface; new updates are necessary to keep up with recent tech. Without any clear guide toward its development, it becomes obsolete. This has likely been the case some developers have faced as they ignore a system’s life cycle. A system life cycle isn’t just about planning, it also involves making sure a digital system, can continue to grow or evolve, adapt, and continue to prosper! The life cycle system is composed of 6 stages, each encompassing an important part of what the continued development of a digital system should look like.</p>
            <h3>Defining the Systems Life Cycle </h3>
            <p>A system life cycle can simply be defined, as the name suggests, the development of a system’s life cycle. We watch as a digital system evolves over time, models are typically used to demonstrate a behavioral representation of a given entity. As mentioned above, the life cycle system is composed of 6 stages: conception, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement.</p>
            <p>Conception is made up of the identifiers and needs of a system. It begins with the initial idea which is then expanded upon or explored. The phase involves defining a system’s purpose and any other objectives it may have. Stakeholders come together to get an understanding of the system and outline outcomes that may be wanted.</p>
            <p>The development stage in the systems life cycle focuses on exploring potential solutions for any needs and selecting the best solution to continue forward. According to our text, Systems Engineering Demystified, states “This Stage may also involve developing a prototype prior to the Production Stage.” Doing so only continues to provide a clearer view of what the system will look like.</p>
            <p>The production stage our solution from before and creates the actual system. There is testing involved with this stage as to ensure the system functions correctly. “the System is built right (verification) and that the right System is built (validation).” This stage involves creating the final system based on the prototype developed earlier (during the development stage).</p>
            <p>The utilization stage describes the use of the system, in other words, we are monitoring how the system operate in its environment, analyzing whether or not the system is providing the expected outcomes and value to its users and stakeholders. The goal is to ensure reliability within the system and to address any issues concerning its operation when they do arise.</p>
            <p>The support stage focuses primarily on providing support services to the system, maintenance and reporting errors are just one part of this as the goal is to also extend the usability of a system over time.</p>
            <p>Retirement, the final stage of the life cycle system marks the end of a system’s use, when the time comes to be decommissioned. The goal is to responsibly phase out the system while minimizing risks and costs associated with its discontinuation.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Managing a system’s life cycle is essential to systems engineering. Developers use a wide array of models to effectively map out the trajectory of a system’s life cycle. We see how strategic planning and development shape project outcomes. In the end a system's life cycle isn't just designed from a technical approach, it's a way of thinking that's necessary to create systems that continue to progress, and strive. As new systems are created, the life cycle of systems will continue to set the primary example of how any system should develop and progress.</p>

               <h2>Module 2.1 Blog Post</h2>

            <h3>Designing for People</h3>
            <p>No one likes the feeling of being left confused or frustrated when navigating the digital world, yet, this is an experience shared by many all across the world. Whether that be trying to understand Apple’s vague prompts concerning low storage space (as there is no clear guidance on how to resolve the issue), or Microsoft’s difficulties in providing a clear subscription cancelling process for Xbox Gold users, these moments highlight one of the most critical failures in digital design: forgetting the human in midst of the experience. When an interface becomes overwhelming or lackluster, users tend to leave feeling disconnected from the experience. It is not a trend, but a necessity to “design for people”. It is important to understand the manner in which users perceive information, their limitations, and where their attention falls the most. By taking into account these things, designers can create intuitive and helpful interfaces which can become enjoyable to use. To “design for people” means to create a digital experience that prioritizes the limitations, perceptions, and attention of the people.</p>
            <h3>Understanding Human-Centered Design</h3>
            <p>ISO 9241-210, also known as Human-Centered Design for interactive systems, is a standard first published in 1999. The basic structure of this standard continues to be widely used today as it is still applicable in a variety of ideas. Chapter 4 of HCD for Interactive Systems states that “The basic idea of this ISO standard is to develop interactive systems (or products or services) that have good usability.” The mentioned ISO (9241-210) standard is focused on helping people create interactive systems. This can be in the form of things like websites, digital tools, software, and services that are made with the intent to be easy and useful for users to interact with, it’s most widely used in UX (user-experience) design. The basic idea of this standard is easy to understand, though in practice, can be much harder than what was initially presumed. Time must be taken to have a clear understanding one’s users and environment, as whatever can be learned through desk research is not enough. “You require the direct involvement of users in the design and development of the solution…. collect feedback, through various methods, from users regarding the design solutions.” The ISO standard is implemented into a design based on a development team’s competencies, as well as the specific product, service, or system. Competencies are determined primarily by the aforementioned traits. Similar systems are observed to gather an idea of how to go about solving the problem at hand, one can discover any potential flaws or strengths the two compared systems share to determine the next steps in design moving forward. Part of what makes Human-Centered Design important is its emphasis on empathy, as the standard suggests a deep understanding of the context, limitations, and goals of users. Design decisions also take into account what users actually experience rather than simply focusing on the technical needs of a system.</p>
            <h3>ISO 9241-210 vs IDEO’s Field Guide</h3>
            <p>IDEO’s Field Guide focuses on the impact Human-Centered design can have in the social sector, it follows processes built primarily on the use of empathy and innovation. The field guide drives its focus on fluid iteration, as learning by doing is emphasized in the design process. Innovation and human connection are at the forefront of this guide, which tends to lead off some from the ISO standard. Similarly to IDEO’s field guide, ISO 9241-210 shares some qualities which spark empathy. As mentioned a plethora of times before, empathy is at the core of the IDEO design process. “We iterate because we know that we won’t get it right the first time…you can advance your idea without investing hours and resources until you’re sure that it’s the one.” The field guide supports a process involving flexibility to meet its design goals. By doing so, it encourages designers to stay open-minded, adapt to new insights, and respond to real human needs as they emerge, rather than sticking to a rigid plan that might miss the mark to human-centered-design. Prototypes and constant trial and error is IDEOs advocated system of progression. The guide encourages developers to think through action, this means working through tangible solutions to gain insight rather than through concept or idea. Overall, the IDEO field guide presents the idea that a solution to a problem can be found through creative approaches, trial and error, and collaboration. The guide empowers and encourages teams to embrace ambiguity to solve design errors and flaws, as well as challenge drawn out planning through plain creativity. On the other hand, the ISO standard takes into account user understanding and context through direct involvement rather than from the position of a desk. Instead of having a focus on processes derived from innovation, the standard is driven through an organized, step-by-step structure. Its process is systematic, with a heavy focus on formalities to ensure usability, and functionality for its users. Both approaches to Human-Centered Design lead to usable solutions to solve its problems, though the path in which those problems are solved can be different. Whether the ISO standard or the IDEO guide is used is dependent upon the preference of developers and the context of the situation, where one method might fail, the other may prove successful.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>To conclude, human-centered design is at the forefront of user experience and UI design. It takes into account the truth that technology should work for all people and that it should be no other way. When designers understand the way users interact with their digital environments, they can create functional, reliable, and enjoyable experiences. We are offered two different perspectives useful in web design through ISO 9241-210, and IDEOs field guide as they are used to demonstrate the importance of shaping human-centered outcomes, regardless of the route or path used to get there. Designing for people means more than just solving any old technical problem, it's centered around the idea of understanding human needs, behaviors, goals, and frustrations. There are no changes to this goal regardless of the method used. IDEOs creative process, and ISO 9241-210s organized structure are still both used to support the people using them in their digital environments. As methods like these continue to change and grow to become more popular, so too will the need for a user-focused design for every digital environment.</p>
