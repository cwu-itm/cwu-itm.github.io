               <h2>Module 1.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <p>When dealing with complex projects that have many different moving parts and processes, being able to understand that complexity through an examination of each of those parts enables you to approach challenges that may arise from different perspectives. This process is called Systems Thinking and it is a useful framework that helps to identify all the elements of a project and how they work together. Designing systems today is a challenging task. There are many moving pieces and processes to understand. Systems thinking provides you with the ability to see everything compared to a more traditional linear thinking method. This paper will seek to define systems thinking, how it compares to linear thinking, and will explain why a model-based approach is a key part in designing complex systems.</p>
            <h3>What is Systems Thinking?</h3>
            <p>Systems Thinking is the idea of taking a project or system and breaking it down into parts that gives you a deeper understanding on how those parts work together to create said system or project. What is the goal of the system? The purpose of its existence? Once the goal has been identified, you can expand on the elements that are striving to accomplish said goal and define the interconnected dependency between the elements (Arnold & Wade, 2015). 
	Another way of looking at systems thinking is that it is the practice of understanding the bigger picture. Each element within a system is connected in some way. Changes to these elements may cause intended or unintended consequences to others, disrupting the system in positive or negative ways. 
	Knowing the different concepts that help to create the systems thinking approach should provide a better view on how this approach can help and why it is beneficial. With systems thinking, you identify how each element within the system works together, or how it is interconnected. When working with digital systems, this interconnectedness is highlighted through events. For example, a new feature may be implemented that causes a change in user behavior, which could affect the performance of the system. This performance change, whether a positive or negative change, will then affect user behavior again. This lifecycle forces you to look past each isolated element and consider how one change affects multiple relationships.
	Feedback loops are another piece of the system’s thinking puzzle that helps you to understand how a system’s output loops back as an input. Systems can act in unpredictable ways, making it difficult to identify trends, but a feedback loop can provide clarity on the dynamic behavior of the system. An example of this would be a social media post. A post that goes viral could increase site traffic, this increase in traffic will increase visibility of the viral post, which in turn will again increase the traffic. 
	As stated earlier, one of the most important characteristics of the systems thinking approach is gaining perspective of the entire system at play. Asking how components interact with one another, or how does this system react to change, will create that whole system viewpoint, instead of saying, “If this happens, do this.”. Why did that event happen and are there any long-term consequences to this interaction? This makes sure that any decision being made is in support of the overall system and not local, isolated adjustments.
</p>
            <h3>Systems Thinking vs. Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>From a surface level perspective, systems thinking and linear thinking could be considered the same thing. They both are utilized to make informed decisions and fix problems within a system, but that is where the similarities truly end. Each one, while seemingly having the same end goal, is designed to fix things from different points of view. 
	Linear thinking is a more structured process compared to systems thinking. It is a logical, step-by-step process that has a starting point, middle engagement points, and a defined conclusion (MindManager, n.d.). A perfectly suitable process when dealing with the isolated parts of a complex system, such as finding and removing bugs from software. When you widen the view of the system to encompass all the complex parts and processes, the linear thinking approach begins to break down as it is not designed to handle whole complex systems with multiple reasons for events to take place.
	Another major difference between the two methods is that linear thinking is more of the operational side, whereas systems thinking is more of a learning process. Systems thinking approaches understanding of systems through learning and continuous improvement, focusing on root cause analysis as opposed to just fixing an isolated problem (Critical Thinking Secrets, n.d.). This approach allows for strategies that focus on long-term success. This doesn’t mean that linear thinking does not have a place in maintaining complex systems but rather highlights when and who should use the linear approach and when to use the systems thinking approach. 
	The difference between linear and systems thinking isn’t just about how to approach issues. It is important to understand other aspects that can have an impact on the system itself and its end users. Since linear is more focused on specific pathways and processes, it often requires more stable or predictable environments. If X happens, then Y happens every time. A systems approach benefits from dynamic environments, or one where you try to understand why X happened in the first place and whether there is an underlying cause that needs to be fixed. This plays into the outcome of said elements. In a linear thinking approach, you typically know the intended consequences for a sequence of actions. Y happens when X happens. The systems approach forces you to look for the unintended consequences of specific actions and how to pivot when and if those events occur. This makes it incredibly difficult to implement the linear thinking approach to more complex systems as it cannot handle the stress of ambiguity.
</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Approaches in Complex Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>Once you understand the systems that you are working with, through systems thinking, you need to present this system clearly to all stakeholders invested in the system. If there is any misunderstanding of the system or its approach in achieving its goal, it can cause delays in the output or create uncertainty within the stakeholder circle. A Model-Based Approach provides everyone involved with a model of a clear view of the system and breakdowns of all elements. This model is the only representation of the system that will be used and all of the information that is provided is true, no matter what tool is being used or which area of the model you are referring to, and is consistent across all verticals (Holt, 2023).
	These models are extremely necessary within complex digital environments because the amount of information needed to understand the systems is too great for someone to remember. These models help to identify small, nuanced relationships and activities that may otherwise go unnoticed. With how diverse a team can be when managing digital systems, making sure everyone is on the same page from a language perspective is crucial. Your engineers, designers, and stakeholders need to understand the system from their respective roles. The model is a unified reference point that anyone can use to understand what resources are needed and when, reducing the number of misunderstandings or any misalignments that may arise. 
	Another area that is beneficial to a model-based approach is testing. If you are designing and running a complex system, running tests in real time can have dire consequences. Running new features before properly tested can cause outages, end user issues, and even security breaches. Models allow you to test these scenarios before implementation, providing detail into what could and what couldn’t work. The UX and user behavior is important to designers when creating new systems and models help them see how any changes made can affect engagement across multiple areas. Additionally, models can help with identifying vulnerabilities in the system, helping to enhance overall security. 
	When dealing with complex systems, you want to have a model in place that allows for a strong foundation, removing any failure points early. If the system being created needs to scale with the growth of a company, the models can allow for that testing to see how scalable the system really is. The more information that is provided within a model, the better stakeholders can make decisions that are based on evidence and real data, rather than intuition alone.
</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking provides stakeholders with a way to understand a complex system beyond standard operating procedures. By focusing on the system as a whole and not individual parts, it provides a more accurate interpretation of how the system will function. In contrast, the traditional linear thinking approach is designed to fix isolated issues with short-term results, compared to a systems thinking long-term viability. While ideal for simple, predictable events, the linear approach breaks down once introduced to complex environments with unpredictable behaviors or correlations. As digital systems expand, the limitations of the linear approach become increasingly apparent and hard to ignore.
	The model-based approach helps team members and stakeholders to all be aligned when creating and managing complex systems. It provides designers with the opportunity to test ideas and scenarios without real world ramifications and creates a unified outlook across teams when navigating elements that will rely on others to work properly. When combined with systems thinking, it allows users to create complex digital systems that are stable and functional and allows that system to evolve over time based on the needs of the business and its users. An essential combination when managing a digital landscape that is rapidly changing and defined by complex interconnected elements.

               <h2 style="text-align: center;">Module 1.2 Blog Post - The Systems Development Life Cycle</h2>
            </header>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Like any project or goal, a well-developed plan must be created initially to address any potential issues that may arise through out development. Without a plan, those issues may create delays or, in worse case scenarios, require a project to be abandoned. This post will explore the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and three life cycle models, linear, iterative, and incremental. It will define the SDLC, examine the models, identifying advantages and disadvantages, and reflect on how the life cycle aids in designing, sustaining, and evolving digital systems.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Systems Development Life Cycle</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">When designing new digital systems, the Systems Development Life Cycle approach is utilized to guide teams through the process. This framework is comprised of multiple steps and developmental processes that come together to describe the full journey of a system. This “full journey” includes identifying a specific need, the design and implementation, as well as maintenance, and if applicable, end of life.
Developing a new system without a life cycle framework in place can create many problems. Requirements may not be met or defined properly, systems may become too difficult to maintain, or decisions are not consistent across teams. The SDLC is designed to provide clarity and a predictable structure when creating complex digital systems. It helps to bring coordination between teams, helping to manage potential risks, and aligns everyone involved with the needs of the user and the goals of the organization.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Phases of SDLC</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">No system is static, meaning they are constantly changing over time. They will evolve, degrade, and function differently depending on changes to its environment. This requires phases the flexibility to be altered, reclassified, and even omitted depending on the needs of the system. Most SDLC models will include the following phases:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
  <li><b>Planning:</b> This initial phase is crucial in setting the tone for the entire cycle. Teams will use this phase to list feature requirements and ground the project into something actionable. During this stage, teams won’t specify how they will implement certain features or functionality and the programming languages aren’t typically chosen (Tozzi, 2024).</li><br>
  <li><b>Analysis:</b> This phase defines the user needs and the requirements for the system. Teams will create a plan that identifies any constraints and how they can implement feature needs surfaced during the planning phase.</li><br>
  <li><b>Design:</b> During the design phase of the SDLC, teams will create the database models and interfaces end users will interact with. System components are also defined, providing teams with technical guidance for future phases.</li><br>
  <li><b>Implementation:</b> This phase can sometimes be named Development, but the definition is still the same. Within this phase, the actual code used to develop the system is built.</li><br>
  <li><b>Testing:</b> The Testing phase can only be met when the code has been written from the previous implementation phase. This phase involves verifying the functionality of the system, its security, and reliability.</li><br>
  <li><b>Deployment:</b> This phase is the first one in which the end user can interact with the newly developed system. </li><br>
  <li><b>Maintenance:</b> The final phase in the SDLC is the maintenance phase. Within this phase, the system is monitored, and a process is set in place to update, fix, and improve the system over its lifetime.</li><br>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Linear Life Cycle Models</h3>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Linear Life Cycle Model is constructed of a sequential progression path through the different SDLC phases. One example of a linear life cycle model is the Waterfall model, in which each phase is initiated only after the completion of the previous phase, with no way to circle back around to a previous phase (Holt, 2023).</p>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The linear model excels in projects that are small and are predictable. Because of well-defined requirements created early in the process, it requires straightforward planning that is easy to understand and manage. That requirement is also one of its biggest drawbacks as the linear model struggles to perform in complex environments where needs evolve. Due to the progression of the linear model, testing often occurs near the end of the cycle which may cause problems to surface too late to repair.
This model is ideal for industries that rely on control and predictability; however, within the more complex and face-paced digital environments, the drawbacks associated with the linear model can potentially have a significant negative impact on the stability of system.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Iterative Life Cycle Models</h3>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Iterative model is a much more flexible option compared to the linear model. Instead of building out a system all at once, a version of the system is created by teams, which is then evaluated, and improved on in future iterations. Each iteration of the system includes phases separate from each version. Each life cycle is repeated and again, being refined each time.</p>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">One of the main advantages of the iterative model is the ability to have an early working version of the system available to users. This provides you with quicker feedback and helps to build trust through continuous improvements that align more with user needs and expectations (Half, 2025). Like the linear model, the iterative model also has drawbacks tied directly to its advantages. Without proper feedback from stakeholders, the ability to improve on user issues becomes increasingly difficult throughout the systems life. Additionally, if there are no parameters set into place on an iteration, the potential for scope creep rises. 
The iterative model is perfect for complex systems that have a high level of uncertainty attached to them as its flexible nature allows teams to pivot when an issue surfaces. In a complex digital system, the need for flexibility is key when working with changing stakeholder needs.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Incremental Life Cycle Models</h3>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The incremental model is like the iterative model in that both systems build on each other expanding and refining components. The difference being that the incremental model breaks down the system into easier to manage chunks. Each increment has its own phases like the iterative model, but adds new functionality to the previous release, continuing until the system is complete, coining the alternative term “Iterative Enhancement” approach (TpointTech, 2025).</p>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The incremental model allows for greater scalability as new increments can be added when user needs change over time. It also provides a quicker way for users to try new features through the different increments instead of waiting for the entire system to be completed. While this model provides a great way to see a system function in its final form early on, it is not suitable for systems that can’t be broken down into subsets (Holt, 2023).
Incremental models are ideal for modern digital environments as they allow for continuous improvement when technology and the user’s needs change. Issues may arise with projects that are poorly planned or communication between teams is insufficient.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why Life Cycle Thinking is Important for Digital Systems</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The purpose of implementing life cycle thinking into digital systems is to help create a strong structural foundation for the system that encompasses its entire lifespan. It helps to support the sustainability of a system.
For designers and engineers, they can consider multiple areas of the system’s lifespan, such as how scalable the system is, how will the system be maintained, is it future-proof, and will it ever need to be replaced. It helps to reduce the risk of uninformed short-term decisions.
As stated earlier, the system is not static. It requires constant updates, improvements, and patches. Without utilizing life cycle thinking, you could build a system that may function but would degrade rapidly over time. Making sure your system has resources properly allocated and there is sufficient documentation available for maintenance ensures you are supporting sustainability throughout the system’s lifespan.
Systems that are unable to evolve over time will become obsolete extremely fast. Life cycle thinking ensures that a system is built to be adaptable. Within a digital system, so many areas constantly change, whether that is a user need, the technology running the system, or laws are set in place, being able to pivot is crucial.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Trying to build a digital system without a structured framework is like trying to build a house without a blueprint. You may be able to construct something that is functional initially, but over time, the cracks will start to appear and may be irreversible. Implementing SDLC models offers stability to make sure your system functions properly. It helps teams to anticipate unforeseen changes and manage large, complex processes, while building systems that can improve and evolve over time.</p>

            <header class="article-header">
               <h2 style="text-align: center;">Module 2.1 Blog Post - Human First</h2>
            </header>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Design Begins with People</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The concept of human-centered design is one that is talked about frequently, so much so that the importance of it is often lost through this repetition. It becomes more about the phrase and less about the actual meaning. Peeling back the layers of what it means to design for a human helps to ground the concept, allowing you to realize that it isn’t about making interfaces look good or following the latest trend, it is about how humans perceive and interact with the information provided. Designing with people in mind helps to expand from a singular perspective into being able to see multiple perspectives.</p><br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This article will explore this concept by understanding how perception, attention, and empathy help to shape the design. Two approaches to the human-centered design will be compared, ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide to Human-Centered Design, and a connection will be created between these ideas and the four UX laws: Jakob’s Law, Fitts’s Law, Hick’s Law, and Miller’s Law. 
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Human-Centered Design</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">First published in 1999, the most used process in UX is the ISO 9241-210, a human-centered design approach that focuses on developing interactive systems that are useful and have good usability for users, focusing on their needs and requirements (Benjamin Franz, 2024). This concept is structured in a way that spotlights the usability and requirements, understanding the user, evaluating the design, refining that design, and then repeating the steps.
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The IDEO’s Field Guide is still a human-centered design approach; however, instead of the rigid, static process of ISO 9241-210, the Field Guide takes a more creative and empathetic approach. This concept encourages designers to look at the people that will utilize the system. Focusing on their stories and frustrations. It helps designers to understand the level of ambiguity that can be present, empowering them to discover over checking off a list. Allowing ambiguity as a part of the process can help to identify answers and innovation that may not be visible during a standard process, embracing optimism to find answers (IDEO, 2015).
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Both approaches focus on human-centered design, both have the same goal, to serve people, but their ways of serving are where they become different. ISO 9241-210, even in name, embodies a more consistent, measurable approach, whereas IDEO’s Field Guide, better suited name for its unique approach, focuses on empathy, exploration, and understanding problems.
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Utilizing both when designing could provide beneficial results as both attack different key areas. The ISO approach will allow for more accessibility and usability. The Field Guide will help you to uncover the issues and needs that may not have surfaced in previous investigations.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Perception and Visual Hierarchy</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">A screen with no words still tells a story. Each person that views this screen will see something different or may not see everything that another person sees. This is one of the most important things to understand when designing, people don’t and will not see everything on the screen. A user’s perception is always selective. They will only see what stands out. Whether that is something on the screen that aligns with their needs, or the omission of it, their attention will only be processed so much.
 <p style="text-indent: 2em;">When creating a system, designers need to guide the user’s perception so that the story is conveyed in the proper, intended way. A visual hierarchy is a tool designers will use to help organize that story, providing a rhythm to the content, telling users where to look, what to do, and what they can ignore (Gerencer, 2025).
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The first UX law that will be discussed, Jakob’s Law, has relevancy when it comes to perception and visual hierarchy. This law, enabled in 2000, encourages designers to create a cumulative experience for users based on other websites they have visited, allowing them to focus more on the content instead of interface issues or design flaws (Yablonski, 2024). Familiar patterns can help to reduce a user’s cognitive load during a visit as they do not need to learn the new layout or design. A well-structured visual hierarchy combined with familiar elements can make even the most complex system seem simple and intuitive for the user.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Attention</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Think about a website you have recently visited that was an overload of information upon initial visit. There are menus and options laid out in almost every corner, images of random events and people that don’t seem to correlate with the supposed journey. The harder you make it for the user to choose what to do, the more frustrated they become and the experience turns negative. Hick’s Law presents us with the notion that the more you present to a user, the more difficult it will be for said user to decide (Stevens, 2024). Your user’s attention is one of the hardest resources to control in any interaction. There needs to be a smooth experience for users to gain that attention and keep it. 
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Additionally, the time that is required for a user to reach their intended destination is crucial in developing an infrastructure that creates a positive experience. Fitts’s Law is helpful in this situation as it provides designers with an understanding of how humans move. By adhering to specific guidelines, designers can make sure that touch targets on mobile devices are large enough for fingers and in a desktop setting, focal points are in natural locations users expect.
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The final UX law this post will examine is Miller’s Law. People are only able to hold so much information at one time. The more the input exceeds the output in this situation, the users will struggle to mentally keep up with tasks becoming increasingly difficult as time progresses, increasing the risk of missed information and frustration (Yablonski, 2024). Chunking the content and breaking down long areas of text can help users absorb the content better and improve overall usability.
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The less time designers put into cognitive areas such as the examples above, the more the interface will feel overly complex and unintuitive to the user. Designers must find the right balance when designing systems, making sure the interfaces are as seamless and easy to use as can be allowed.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Empathy</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">When you design for people, you need to consider that their environment when accessing your system may not be the most ideal. You must acknowledge that they may be distracted while visiting, are looking for a short experience due to time constraints, may have personal attachments to the interactions provided, or just don’t understand the designer’s vision. 
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Empathy should be considered a hybrid skill, rather than a soft skill. It is a critical skill for any designer that wants to understand their users actions and why those chose them. As stated earlier, one of IDEO’s Field Guide’s main focal points is to encourage empathy. It allows designers to create experiences based on needs that are often missed in usability tests and keeps the user focused on your work and intended outcomes.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Designing for People</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Developing a complex system is no easy task, there are many different user needs and requirements that you must consider; however, with the combination of a designer’s understanding of perception, attention, and empathy, with a hybrid approach of the more structured ISO and the creative Field Guide, the human-centered design becomes clear and well defined. 
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Anyone can make a slick system with modern interfaces and aesthetics, but if the human component is missing, the system fails. Designing for people reminds you to create with the intent to align with human needs and keeping those needs grounded in reality. It’s making sure you understand that there is no static path when catering to users as every element is a variable. A good designer will meet them at their threshold to reduce the cognitive load and create a positive UX journey.

          <h3 style="text-align: center;">Making A Digital System Usable</h3>
           <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Placing a modern or clean look in a digital system does not make that system any easier to use. You cannot say your system has an intuitive design, yet asks for unnecessary lifts from the user, increasing the cognitive load and making even the simplest task feel like taking on the fight of your life. Making a system “usable” can only be achieved when it can respect how a person thinks. It is less about the look and more about the function.
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This post will explore how memory and mental models influence user interactions, why consistency and system feedback are crucial in improving usability, and how poor design choices can create unnecessary cognitive load for the user. We will use a combination of course materials, Tesler’s Law, UX principles, including personal experiences.
</p> 
 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Memory and Mental Models</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Our ability, as humans, to remember and memorize is extremely powerful; however, it has extreme limitations to balance out those powers. If digital systems ignore those limitations of the human mind, it creates friction that provides a poor user experience. It is only when a system is built around those limitations will it succeed.</p>
 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Working Memory</h3> 
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Our ability to hold information, or working memory, like some inner mental notepad, is extremely small. In fact, a paper titled “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,” proposed that seven, plus or minus two, is the limit humans have for the number of unrelated items in working memory (Johnson, 2013). When a system requires users to remember more than the ideal number of steps, it begins to put strain on the working memory, an already limited resource.</p>
<p>Real-World Examples:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I once worked at a tech company that required the use of the most complex meeting scheduling system I have ever experienced. Each room was named, so it sounds easy enough, find the name of the room you want to reserve and the time. The problem was the nomenclature was the same throughout multiple buildings, so you needed to know the building name, floor number, room name, time, whether electronics were needed, etc. This was on top of not being able to modify choices, so if I made a mistake, I could either cancel and start all over or send the invite out and start making real-time adjustments. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Due to constant moving around, sometimes it was difficult to remember what building you were in. If the system allowed for details to help guide me along the process, making sure I didn’t make any mistakes, it would have helped to reduce my cognitive load, focusing more on me remembering every piece of information, rather than understanding the system.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Mental Models</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">A mental model is how people form representations of how a system works. Think of them as whole brain events, a combination of areas of the brain contributing to build this idea of the working system and, because they aren’t static, how they change over time (Duncan, 2025). When a system can align with a user’s mental model, their past experiences, cultural norms, etc., they begin to feel more intuitive, all because of structure, not aesthetics.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">When visiting a company web page, most users would expect to interact with designs that they have learned from thousands of digital experiences. A logo returning them to the homepage or a shopping cart icon letting users see what items they have chosen to purchase. </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">If a system breaks from the norms, users begin to lose trust. They second-guess their actions and the goal of the system they are intending to use. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">I recently visited a web site that sold various items for men. From clothing to home goods, it was sort of like a one-stop-shop. Their issue was with their menu layout they chose to use. Instead of having parent categories within a dropdown menu, they placed each category along the menu line. One link was to their home goods section; however, when you click a link, you couldn’t go back to the homepage by clicking their logo. If you clicked “Home”, it wouldn’t take you home, but to the “Home Goods” section. The only way to go back was to physically use the back button on your web browser. An extremely disorienting moment, nothing breaking, but noticeable. </p>

    Once you have a pattern understood, you become reliant on it. You expect it to work the same way every time, placing yourself into a momentary autopilot mode. This reliance comes from everything, the button placement, logos and labels, and more complex ones like workflows. Disrupt any of those and you increase the cognitive effort needed to accomplish the same tasks, turning what was once an automated procedure into a mentally draining manual one.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Consistency and Feedback</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Consistency and Feedback are two usability principles that help to reduce the cognitive load of system users. They help them to feel in control when making decisions and reinforce mental models.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Consistency</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Not to be confused with homogenizing a system, consistency, or design consistency, is a principle used in creating systems that enhance the experience through uniformity across elements (Falode, 2024). Consistency allows a user to rely on recognizing familiar patterns and processes rather than recalling them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">When elements such as button placement, typography, and navigation structure are stable, confidence in users will build. On the other hand, if there are too many shifts, that confidence wanes and users must resort to re-learning areas of the system.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Feedback</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This usability principle is integral in letting users know that a system they are using has received whatever action they have made and is actively setting out to accomplish that task. When there is no feedback provided, it leaves users feeling unsure about what they have done. This triggers events such as repeated clicks, mis-clicks, and even abandoning the task altogether.</p>
<figure style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; width: 450px; text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8a4f8d2c-5f71-4233-b4ac-a135a970521a/floops-loops.png" alt="description" style="width: 100%;">

    Good feedback is almost instantaneous and clear. The user understands what the feedback is, where it comes from, and why it is happening. It doesn’t overwhelm the user with extensive information, just what is needed. This could be something as simple as a button changing color after it is clicked or a confirmation message appearing after you have submitted a form.
</p>

            <br>
            <br>
           <p style="text-indent: 2em;">These small but extremely important signals help to improve the usability by letting the users see what is happening, not trying to guess if they did the task correctly.</p>
 <p>Real-World Examples:</p>  
 <p style="text-indent: 2em;">I recently made a purchase online for a pretty significant amount of money. I did tons of research to make sure that the website that I ordered from was legit and I wouldn’t be a part of any scam. Upon completing my purchase, I was given no notification that the payment went through or the order was received. I saw the money come out of my account and started to panic, thinking I did something wrong and maybe I inadvertently canceled the order or worse, got scammed. Two emails and a phone call later the company was able to see that their notification system had gone down and wasn’t sending confirmation emails. This helped me to gain trust again but shows that missing feedback only leads to confusion and loss of trust.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">When Designs Fail</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As mentioned earlier in this post, creating poorly designed systems not only slows down how a user interacts with it, but it also increases the cognitive load. When systems require more of the user than is needed, or convey unclear messages, cognitive load rears its ugly head.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Tesler’s Law</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">What happens if you can’t reduce a process or design any further to reduce the complexity of it? What do you do with those pieces of the system that are complex by design and are integral to basic system functionality? </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Tesler’s Law, sometimes known as the Law of Conservation of Complexity, claims that every system created has a level of complexity that cannot be reduced or eliminated, just moved around for the lack of a better phrase (Yablonski, 2024). So, who gets to carry this additional burden? It depends on the system.</p>      
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Think of it like this, a system with good usability will take on the added complexity to strive for a better user experience. The poor system will make the user carry the weight. A poor example of a system passing the burden to the user is through a checkout process that requires the user to input both shipping and billing even if the address is the same. A system with good usability would require the user to enter one or the other and then click a box stating, “shipping is the same as billing.” Having users enter in the information manually twice increases the risk of error, which is what Tesler’s Law is trying to warn. When a designer fails to balance the complexity of a system, the user is the one who pays the higher price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Usability and Respect</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Usability is a small act of respect. You keep the user’s experience in mind and acknowledge the elements they bring during an interaction. Usability understands that resources are finite and the phrase, “Less is more,” is the motto. A usable system helps to create intuitive experiences for users and is predictable, adapting to their way of thinking. When a digital system can respect the human mind and how it functions, they become aligned and the interaction becomes seamless.</p>
