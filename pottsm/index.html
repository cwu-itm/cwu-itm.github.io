            </header>
            <p>When dealing with complex projects that have many different moving parts and processes, being able to understand that complexity through an examination of each of those parts enables you to approach challenges that may arise from different perspectives. This process is called Systems Thinking and it is a useful framework that helps to identify all the elements of a project and how they work together. Designing systems today is a challenging task. There are many moving pieces and processes to understand. Systems thinking provides you with the ability to see everything compared to a more traditional linear thinking method. This paper will seek to define systems thinking, how it compares to linear thinking, and will explain why a model-based approach is a key part in designing complex systems.</p>
            <h3>What is Systems Thinking?</h3>
            <p>Systems Thinking is the idea of taking a project or system and breaking it down into parts that gives you a deeper understanding on how those parts work together to create said system or project. What is the goal of the system? The purpose of its existence? Once the goal has been identified, you can expand on the elements that are striving to accomplish said goal and define the interconnected dependency between the elements (Arnold & Wade, 2015). 
	Another way of looking at systems thinking is that it is the practice of understanding the bigger picture. Each element within a system is connected in some way. Changes to these elements may cause intended or unintended consequences to others, disrupting the system in positive or negative ways. 
	Knowing the different concepts that help to create the systems thinking approach should provide a better view on how this approach can help and why it is beneficial. With systems thinking, you identify how each element within the system works together, or how it is interconnected. When working with digital systems, this interconnectedness is highlighted through events. For example, a new feature may be implemented that causes a change in user behavior, which could affect the performance of the system. This performance change, whether a positive or negative change, will then affect user behavior again. This lifecycle forces you to look past each isolated element and consider how one change affects multiple relationships.
	Feedback loops are another piece of the system’s thinking puzzle that helps you to understand how a system’s output loops back as an input. Systems can act in unpredictable ways, making it difficult to identify trends, but a feedback loop can provide clarity on the dynamic behavior of the system. An example of this would be a social media post. A post that goes viral could increase site traffic, this increase in traffic will increase visibility of the viral post, which in turn will again increase the traffic. 
	As stated earlier, one of the most important characteristics of the systems thinking approach is gaining perspective of the entire system at play. Asking how components interact with one another, or how does this system react to change, will create that whole system viewpoint, instead of saying, “If this happens, do this.”. Why did that event happen and are there any long-term consequences to this interaction? This makes sure that any decision being made is in support of the overall system and not local, isolated adjustments.
</p>
            <h3>Systems Thinking vs. Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>From a surface level perspective, systems thinking and linear thinking could be considered the same thing. They both are utilized to make informed decisions and fix problems within a system, but that is where the similarities truly end. Each one, while seemingly having the same end goal, is designed to fix things from different points of view. 
	Linear thinking is a more structured process compared to systems thinking. It is a logical, step-by-step process that has a starting point, middle engagement points, and a defined conclusion (MindManager, n.d.). A perfectly suitable process when dealing with the isolated parts of a complex system, such as finding and removing bugs from software. When you widen the view of the system to encompass all the complex parts and processes, the linear thinking approach begins to break down as it is not designed to handle whole complex systems with multiple reasons for events to take place.
	Another major difference between the two methods is that linear thinking is more of the operational side, whereas systems thinking is more of a learning process. Systems thinking approaches understanding of systems through learning and continuous improvement, focusing on root cause analysis as opposed to just fixing an isolated problem (Critical Thinking Secrets, n.d.). This approach allows for strategies that focus on long-term success. This doesn’t mean that linear thinking does not have a place in maintaining complex systems but rather highlights when and who should use the linear approach and when to use the systems thinking approach. 
	The difference between linear and systems thinking isn’t just about how to approach issues. It is important to understand other aspects that can have an impact on the system itself and its end users. Since linear is more focused on specific pathways and processes, it often requires more stable or predictable environments. If X happens, then Y happens every time. A systems approach benefits from dynamic environments, or one where you try to understand why X happened in the first place and whether there is an underlying cause that needs to be fixed. This plays into the outcome of said elements. In a linear thinking approach, you typically know the intended consequences for a sequence of actions. Y happens when X happens. The systems approach forces you to look for the unintended consequences of specific actions and how to pivot when and if those events occur. This makes it incredibly difficult to implement the linear thinking approach to more complex systems as it cannot handle the stress of ambiguity.
</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Approaches in Complex Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>Once you understand the systems that you are working with, through systems thinking, you need to present this system clearly to all stakeholders invested in the system. If there is any misunderstanding of the system or its approach in achieving its goal, it can cause delays in the output or create uncertainty within the stakeholder circle. A Model-Based Approach provides everyone involved with a model of a clear view of the system and breakdowns of all elements. This model is the only representation of the system that will be used and all of the information that is provided is true, no matter what tool is being used or which area of the model you are referring to, and is consistent across all verticals (Holt, 2023).
	These models are extremely necessary within complex digital environments because the amount of information needed to understand the systems is too great for someone to remember. These models help to identify small, nuanced relationships and activities that may otherwise go unnoticed. With how diverse a team can be when managing digital systems, making sure everyone is on the same page from a language perspective is crucial. Your engineers, designers, and stakeholders need to understand the system from their respective roles. The model is a unified reference point that anyone can use to understand what resources are needed and when, reducing the number of misunderstandings or any misalignments that may arise. 
	Another area that is beneficial to a model-based approach is testing. If you are designing and running a complex system, running tests in real time can have dire consequences. Running new features before properly tested can cause outages, end user issues, and even security breaches. Models allow you to test these scenarios before implementation, providing detail into what could and what couldn’t work. The UX and user behavior is important to designers when creating new systems and models help them see how any changes made can affect engagement across multiple areas. Additionally, models can help with identifying vulnerabilities in the system, helping to enhance overall security. 
	When dealing with complex systems, you want to have a model in place that allows for a strong foundation, removing any failure points early. If the system being created needs to scale with the growth of a company, the models can allow for that testing to see how scalable the system really is. The more information that is provided within a model, the better stakeholders can make decisions that are based on evidence and real data, rather than intuition alone.
</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking provides stakeholders with a way to understand a complex system beyond standard operating procedures. By focusing on the system as a whole and not individual parts, it provides a more accurate interpretation of how the system will function. In contrast, the traditional linear thinking approach is designed to fix isolated issues with short-term results, compared to a systems thinking long-term viability. While ideal for simple, predictable events, the linear approach breaks down once introduced to complex environments with unpredictable behaviors or correlations. As digital systems expand, the limitations of the linear approach become increasingly apparent and hard to ignore.
	The model-based approach helps team members and stakeholders to all be aligned when creating and managing complex systems. It provides designers with the opportunity to test ideas and scenarios without real world ramifications and creates a unified outlook across teams when navigating elements that will rely on others to work properly. When combined with systems thinking, it allows users to create complex digital systems that are stable and functional and allows that system to evolve over time based on the needs of the business and its users. An essential combination when managing a digital landscape that is rapidly changing and defined by complex interconnected elements.

               <h2 style="text-align: center;">Module 1.2 Blog Post - The Systems Development Life Cycle</h2>
            </header>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Like any project or goal, a well-developed plan must be created initially to address any potential issues that may arise through out development. Without a plan, those issues may create delays or, in worse case scenarios, require a project to be abandoned. This post will explore the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and three life cycle models, linear, iterative, and incremental. It will define the SDLC, examine the models, identifying advantages and disadvantages, and reflect on how the life cycle aids in designing, sustaining, and evolving digital systems.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Systems Development Life Cycle</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">When designing new digital systems, the Systems Development Life Cycle approach is utilized to guide teams through the process. This framework is comprised of multiple steps and developmental processes that come together to describe the full journey of a system. This “full journey” includes identifying a specific need, the design and implementation, as well as maintenance, and if applicable, end of life.
Developing a new system without a life cycle framework in place can create many problems. Requirements may not be met or defined properly, systems may become too difficult to maintain, or decisions are not consistent across teams. The SDLC is designed to provide clarity and a predictable structure when creating complex digital systems. It helps to bring coordination between teams, helping to manage potential risks, and aligns everyone involved with the needs of the user and the goals of the organization.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Phases of SDLC</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">No system is static, meaning they are constantly changing over time. They will evolve, degrade, and function differently depending on changes to its environment. This requires phases the flexibility to be altered, reclassified, and even omitted depending on the needs of the system. Most SDLC models will include the following phases:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
  <li><b>Planning:</b> This initial phase is crucial in setting the tone for the entire cycle. Teams will use this phase to list feature requirements and ground the project into something actionable. During this stage, teams won’t specify how they will implement certain features or functionality and the programming languages aren’t typically chosen (Tozzi, 2024).</li><br>
  <li><b>Analysis:</b> This phase defines the user needs and the requirements for the system. Teams will create a plan that identifies any constraints and how they can implement feature needs surfaced during the planning phase.</li><br>
  <li><b>Design:</b> During the design phase of the SDLC, teams will create the database models and interfaces end users will interact with. System components are also defined, providing teams with technical guidance for future phases.</li><br>
  <li><b>Implementation:</b> This phase can sometimes be named Development, but the definition is still the same. Within this phase, the actual code used to develop the system is built.</li><br>
  <li><b>Testing:</b> The Testing phase can only be met when the code has been written from the previous implementation phase. This phase involves verifying the functionality of the system, its security, and reliability.</li><br>
  <li><b>Deployment:</b> This phase is the first one in which the end user can interact with the newly developed system. </li><br>
  <li><b>Maintenance:</b> The final phase in the SDLC is the maintenance phase. Within this phase, the system is monitored, and a process is set in place to update, fix, and improve the system over its lifetime.</li><br>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Linear Life Cycle Models</h3>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Linear Life Cycle Model is constructed of a sequential progression path through the different SDLC phases. One example of a linear life cycle model is the Waterfall model, in which each phase is initiated only after the completion of the previous phase, with no way to circle back around to a previous phase (Holt, 2023).</p>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The linear model excels in projects that are small and are predictable. Because of well-defined requirements created early in the process, it requires straightforward planning that is easy to understand and manage. That requirement is also one of its biggest drawbacks as the linear model struggles to perform in complex environments where needs evolve. Due to the progression of the linear model, testing often occurs near the end of the cycle which may cause problems to surface too late to repair.
This model is ideal for industries that rely on control and predictability; however, within the more complex and face-paced digital environments, the drawbacks associated with the linear model can potentially have a significant negative impact on the stability of system.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Iterative Life Cycle Models</h3>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Iterative model is a much more flexible option compared to the linear model. Instead of building out a system all at once, a version of the system is created by teams, which is then evaluated, and improved on in future iterations. Each iteration of the system includes phases separate from each version. Each life cycle is repeated and again, being refined each time.</p>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">One of the main advantages of the iterative model is the ability to have an early working version of the system available to users. This provides you with quicker feedback and helps to build trust through continuous improvements that align more with user needs and expectations (Half, 2025). Like the linear model, the iterative model also has drawbacks tied directly to its advantages. Without proper feedback from stakeholders, the ability to improve on user issues becomes increasingly difficult throughout the systems life. Additionally, if there are no parameters set into place on an iteration, the potential for scope creep rises. 
The iterative model is perfect for complex systems that have a high level of uncertainty attached to them as its flexible nature allows teams to pivot when an issue surfaces. In a complex digital system, the need for flexibility is key when working with changing stakeholder needs.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Incremental Life Cycle Models</h3>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The incremental model is like the iterative model in that both systems build on each other expanding and refining components. The difference being that the incremental model breaks down the system into easier to manage chunks. Each increment has its own phases like the iterative model, but adds new functionality to the previous release, continuing until the system is complete, coining the alternative term “Iterative Enhancement” approach (TpointTech, 2025).</p>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The incremental model allows for greater scalability as new increments can be added when user needs change over time. It also provides a quicker way for users to try new features through the different increments instead of waiting for the entire system to be completed. While this model provides a great way to see a system function in its final form early on, it is not suitable for systems that can’t be broken down into subsets (Holt, 2023).
Incremental models are ideal for modern digital environments as they allow for continuous improvement when technology and the user’s needs change. Issues may arise with projects that are poorly planned or communication between teams is insufficient.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why Life Cycle Thinking is Important for Digital Systems</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The purpose of implementing life cycle thinking into digital systems is to help create a strong structural foundation for the system that encompasses its entire lifespan. It helps to support the sustainability of a system.
For designers and engineers, they can consider multiple areas of the system’s lifespan, such as how scalable the system is, how will the system be maintained, is it future-proof, and will it ever need to be replaced. It helps to reduce the risk of uninformed short-term decisions.
As stated earlier, the system is not static. It requires constant updates, improvements, and patches. Without utilizing life cycle thinking, you could build a system that may function but would degrade rapidly over time. Making sure your system has resources properly allocated and there is sufficient documentation available for maintenance ensures you are supporting sustainability throughout the system’s lifespan.
Systems that are unable to evolve over time will become obsolete extremely fast. Life cycle thinking ensures that a system is built to be adaptable. Within a digital system, so many areas constantly change, whether that is a user need, the technology running the system, or laws are set in place, being able to pivot is crucial.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Trying to build a digital system without a structured framework is like trying to build a house without a blueprint. You may be able to construct something that is functional initially, but over time, the cracks will start to appear and may be irreversible. Implementing SDLC models offers stability to make sure your system functions properly. It helps teams to anticipate unforeseen changes and manage large, complex processes, while building systems that can improve and evolve over time.</p>
