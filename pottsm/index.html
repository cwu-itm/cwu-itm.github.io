            <p>When dealing with complex projects that have many different moving parts and processes, being able to understand that complexity through an examination of each of those parts enables you to approach challenges that may arise from different perspectives. This process is called Systems Thinking and it is a useful framework that helps to identify all the elements of a project and how they work together. Designing systems today is a challenging task. There are many moving pieces and processes to understand. Systems thinking provides you with the ability to see everything compared to a more traditional linear thinking method. This paper will seek to define systems thinking, how it compares to linear thinking, and will explain why a model-based approach is a key part in designing complex systems.</p>
            <h3>What is Systems Thinking?</h3>
            <p>Systems Thinking is the idea of taking a project or system and breaking it down into parts that gives you a deeper understanding on how those parts work together to create said system or project. What is the goal of the system? The purpose of its existence? Once the goal has been identified, you can expand on the elements that are striving to accomplish said goal and define the interconnected dependency between the elements (Arnold & Wade, 2015). 
	Another way of looking at systems thinking is that it is the practice of understanding the bigger picture. Each element within a system is connected in some way. Changes to these elements may cause intended or unintended consequences to others, disrupting the system in positive or negative ways. 
	Knowing the different concepts that help to create the systems thinking approach should provide a better view on how this approach can help and why it is beneficial. With systems thinking, you identify how each element within the system works together, or how it is interconnected. When working with digital systems, this interconnectedness is highlighted through events. For example, a new feature may be implemented that causes a change in user behavior, which could affect the performance of the system. This performance change, whether a positive or negative change, will then affect user behavior again. This lifecycle forces you to look past each isolated element and consider how one change affects multiple relationships.
	Feedback loops are another piece of the system’s thinking puzzle that helps you to understand how a system’s output loops back as an input. Systems can act in unpredictable ways, making it difficult to identify trends, but a feedback loop can provide clarity on the dynamic behavior of the system. An example of this would be a social media post. A post that goes viral could increase site traffic, this increase in traffic will increase visibility of the viral post, which in turn will again increase the traffic. 
	As stated earlier, one of the most important characteristics of the systems thinking approach is gaining perspective of the entire system at play. Asking how components interact with one another, or how does this system react to change, will create that whole system viewpoint, instead of saying, “If this happens, do this.”. Why did that event happen and are there any long-term consequences to this interaction? This makes sure that any decision being made is in support of the overall system and not local, isolated adjustments.

            <h3>Systems Thinking vs. Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>From a surface level perspective, systems thinking and linear thinking could be considered the same thing. They both are utilized to make informed decisions and fix problems within a system, but that is where the similarities truly end. Each one, while seemingly having the same end goal, is designed to fix things from different points of view. 
	Linear thinking is a more structured process compared to systems thinking. It is a logical, step-by-step process that has a starting point, middle engagement points, and a defined conclusion (MindManager, n.d.). A perfectly suitable process when dealing with the isolated parts of a complex system, such as finding and removing bugs from software. When you widen the view of the system to encompass all the complex parts and processes, the linear thinking approach begins to break down as it is not designed to handle whole complex systems with multiple reasons for events to take place.
	Another major difference between the two methods is that linear thinking is more of the operational side, whereas systems thinking is more of a learning process. Systems thinking approaches understanding of systems through learning and continuous improvement, focusing on root cause analysis as opposed to just fixing an isolated problem (Critical Thinking Secrets, n.d.). This approach allows for strategies that focus on long-term success. This doesn’t mean that linear thinking does not have a place in maintaining complex systems but rather highlights when and who should use the linear approach and when to use the systems thinking approach. 
	The difference between linear and systems thinking isn’t just about how to approach issues. It is important to understand other aspects that can have an impact on the system itself and its end users. Since linear is more focused on specific pathways and processes, it often requires more stable or predictable environments. If X happens, then Y happens every time. A systems approach benefits from dynamic environments, or one where you try to understand why X happened in the first place and whether there is an underlying cause that needs to be fixed. This plays into the outcome of said elements. In a linear thinking approach, you typically know the intended consequences for a sequence of actions. Y happens when X happens. The systems approach forces you to look for the unintended consequences of specific actions and how to pivot when and if those events occur. This makes it incredibly difficult to implement the linear thinking approach to more complex systems as it cannot handle the stress of ambiguity.

            <h3>Model-Based Approaches in Complex Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>Once you understand the systems that you are working with, through systems thinking, you need to present this system clearly to all stakeholders invested in the system. If there is any misunderstanding of the system or its approach in achieving its goal, it can cause delays in the output or create uncertainty within the stakeholder circle. A Model-Based Approach provides everyone involved with a model of a clear view of the system and breakdowns of all elements. This model is the only representation of the system that will be used and all of the information that is provided is true, no matter what tool is being used or which area of the model you are referring to, and is consistent across all verticals (Holt, 2023).
	These models are extremely necessary within complex digital environments because the amount of information needed to understand the systems is too great for someone to remember. These models help to identify small, nuanced relationships and activities that may otherwise go unnoticed. With how diverse a team can be when managing digital systems, making sure everyone is on the same page from a language perspective is crucial. Your engineers, designers, and stakeholders need to understand the system from their respective roles. The model is a unified reference point that anyone can use to understand what resources are needed and when, reducing the number of misunderstandings or any misalignments that may arise. 
	Another area that is beneficial to a model-based approach is testing. If you are designing and running a complex system, running tests in real time can have dire consequences. Running new features before properly tested can cause outages, end user issues, and even security breaches. Models allow you to test these scenarios before implementation, providing detail into what could and what couldn’t work. The UX and user behavior is important to designers when creating new systems and models help them see how any changes made can affect engagement across multiple areas. Additionally, models can help with identifying vulnerabilities in the system, helping to enhance overall security. 
	When dealing with complex systems, you want to have a model in place that allows for a strong foundation, removing any failure points early. If the system being created needs to scale with the growth of a company, the models can allow for that testing to see how scalable the system really is. The more information that is provided within a model, the better stakeholders can make decisions that are based on evidence and real data, rather than intuition alone.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking provides stakeholders with a way to understand a complex system beyond standard operating procedures. By focusing on the system as a whole and not individual parts, it provides a more accurate interpretation of how the system will function. In contrast, the traditional linear thinking approach is designed to fix isolated issues with short-term results, compared to a systems thinking long-term viability. While ideal for simple, predictable events, the linear approach breaks down once introduced to complex environments with unpredictable behaviors or correlations. As digital systems expand, the limitations of the linear approach become increasingly apparent and hard to ignore.
	The model-based approach helps team members and stakeholders to all be aligned when creating and managing complex systems. It provides designers with the opportunity to test ideas and scenarios without real world ramifications and creates a unified outlook across teams when navigating elements that will rely on others to work properly. When combined with systems thinking, it allows users to create complex digital systems that are stable and functional and allows that system to evolve over time based on the needs of the business and its users. An essential combination when managing a digital landscape that is rapidly changing and defined by complex interconnected elements.
