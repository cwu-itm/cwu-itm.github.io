         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Hey! This blog is part of a project I’m doing for my Designing Digital Environments class at Central Washington University. The course is split into three parts: first we’re exploring Abstracting Systems through Systems Engineering and MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering), then we’ll move into Designing for People with a focus on UX and cognitive science, and finally we’ll dive into Designing Experiences—whatever that ends up looking like.
</p>
            <p>I’ll be posting reflections and connections as we go, tying each module back to my own work in Technical Writing. My goals will shift with each section, but overall I’m just here to think out loud about how these systems and design ideas fit into the way I approach communication, structure, and clarity.

               <h2>Module 1.1 Blog Post: The Overlap Between MBSE and Technical Writing</h2>
            </header>
            <p>If there’s one thing that’s become clear to me while learning about Systems Engineering and MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering), it’s this: nothing happens in isolation. Not the system, not the documentation, and definitely not the language we use to talk about them.
               Model-Based Systems Engineering and technical communication actually share some overlapping responsibilities. One of the three main causes of system failure is communication: when it fails or becomes ambiguous. The same can be said for technical writing. That’s especially interesting to me, because as a technical writer, my job is to make sure communication is never ambiguous. It should be concise, clear, and accessible.
               Also… didn’t that one plane literally fall out of the sky because of bad documentation? Yeah, that’s right. It did.</p>

               <p>In 2006, the GLO 1907 / Embraer Legacy 600 mid-air collision over Brazil happened because of a mismatch between how aircraft systems behaved and what the documentation and procedures led the crew to expect. The transponder, which powers the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System), was off, and the pilots didn’t realize it. As a result, a Boeing 737 collided with the business jet. The crash sparked major scrutiny of checklist design and pushed for clearer, more reliable cockpit documentation.
               So again: nothing happens in isolation. Not the system, not the documentation, and in the case of MBSE, not the models either.</p>
               <p>In MBSE, this insight, that nothing happens in isolation, is foundational. The very structure of MBSE resists siloed thinking. Instead, it promotes systems thinking, where every element, model, document, and behavior is interdependent and traceable (Holt, 2023, p. 2).
               And that same interdependence? It shows up in our language too, not just in the systems and models, but in how we talk about them.</p>
               </p>
            <h3>Terminology</h3>
            <p>There are two types of language to consider in MBSE: domain-specific language and spoken language. In this blog, my audience expects English. In MBSE, it’s often SysML (Systems Modeling Language). Domain-specific language = jargon. Spoken language = plain language or English. Technical Writing needs to be accessible to those who need the information, so it is written in plain language, which seems to happen often in MBSE, too. 
               You’ll also find overlaps with technical writing and UX here. Just like in UX, Systems Engineering is applied across the entire lifecycle of a system (Holt, 2023, p. 13). And just like UX writers tailor content to users, systems engineers tailor models to stakeholders.
               </p>
            <h3>The Role of Abstraction</h3>
            <p>The most notable thing about MBSE is where the data resides: in the abstraction.
               Abstraction in MBSE means the model contains just enough information to make the system successful. It’s not about storing huge volumes of data. It’s about filtering out what’s unnecessary, just like in technical writing. In tech writing, clarity and precision come from giving users exactly what they need to complete a task or understand a process. Too much becomes noise; too little becomes a barrier. In both cases, you’re creating a meaningful, efficient abstraction of reality.
               </p>
      <h3>The Concept of a View</h3>
      <p>An essential part of any MBSE model is consistency. In MBSE, this is referred to as a View, which is a grouping of information related to a specific concern or stakeholder need.
         A View is a smaller unit of the overall system. Since the system in MBSE is made up of models, and those models only contain relevant information, it follows that Views are composed of relevant groupings. Again: nothing more, nothing less.
        <p> <b>The process of forming a view:</b></p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">
         <li><b>Identify the Stakeholder.</b> Who wants to look at this information? Why? What decisions or actions depend on it?</li>
         <li><b>Define the information.</b> What exactly does this stakeholder need to see?</li>
         <li><b>Clarify the language.</b> What language or terminology makes this information useful to them? Are they a developer (jargon)? A customer (plain language)?</li>
       </ol>
         <p>If information doesn’t meet those three criteria, it’s not a View, it’s just data. And irrelevant data clutters the system.</p>
         Just like in technical writing, MBSE requires you to tailor your message. In technical writing, we often build user personas to understand our audience. In MBSE, stakeholders are clearly defined by their requests and role in the system. The clarity of knowing who wants what helps maintain relevance in the system.

         </p>
            <h3>Single Source of Truth</h3>
            <p>Views must also be consistent with one another. The difference between data and a View is that a View is contextualized and aligned with the rest of the model. If it isn’t, it’s just raw data, fragmented and potentially misleading.
               Once Views and models are consistent, the system can be considered a single source of truth.
               The Introduction to Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and SysML presentation at the Delaware Valley INCOSE Chapter Meeting (2015) emphasized this point: in MBSE, constructs are defined once and reused across the system.
               In technical writing, this same concept exists: single-sourcing. Writers create centralized content modules that can be reused across documents, formats, and platforms (Archbee, n.d.).
               So again, technical writing and MBSE align closely here. Both the document and the model serve as consistent, filtered representations of information, providing the right people with the right information at the right time.
</p>          
<h3>MBSE: The Future?</h3>     
<p>According to multiple sources, MBSE is, and historically has been, expected to become the most widely used systems engineering method.
   In 2012, an article in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics stated:
   “It is expected that this paradigm will become a standard practice in the SE field in the next years... the future of SE will be model-based, embracing high-fidelity static and dynamic models at different levels of abstraction” (Ramos, Ferreira, & Barceló, 2012, p. 106).
   INCOSE’s Vision 2035 also predicts that by 2035, all systems engineering will move “towards a fully Model-Based Systems Engineering environment” and that it will be a cornerstone of digital transformation (INCOSE, 2022).
   But here’s the thing: our course textbook was published in July 2023, and MBSE still isn’t the industry standard. So… what’s holding it up?</p>
  <p>The 2012 article anticipated that a solid MBSE body of knowledge would be achieved within 10 years. Judging by the sheer amount of literature and training materials now available, that prediction seems to have come true.
   But implementation? That’s a different story.</p>
   <p><strong>Here are a few possible reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cultural Shift:</strong> MBSE requires a deep change in how teams think and work. It’s more than adopting a new tool, it’s changing mindsets, workflows, and collaboration styles.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost & Complexity:</strong> The tools and platforms used in MBSE can be expensive and technically demanding. Smaller companies or those running legacy systems often can’t support full adoption.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Languages like SysML require specialized knowledge. Everyone from engineers to stakeholders needs to be trained in how to read and use the models effectively.</li>
</ul>

   <p>Back in 2012, the article stated that MBSE’s potential would only be realized by overcoming cultural and technical barriers. Experts called for metrics, human-centric design, and stronger modeling tools. In many ways, those goals have been reached. It may just take another decade for adoption to catch up, but I agree with INCOSE, it will happen, it’s just a matter of when. </p>
 <p> After all, NASA uses MBSE. And they’re doing some of the most complex systems engineering on the planet.

               <h2>Module 1.2 Blog Post: Life Cycles and Entities in Systems Engineering</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A life cycle describes how one or more entities, typically systems, change over time. In this context, you can think of an entity simply as a system. The core idea is:            </p>

               <p>One or more life cycles describe the evolution of one or more systems.</p>
               <p>This means systems aren’t static. They evolve as they are developed, used, maintained, and eventually retired. A system may begin as a conceptual solution to a user or business need, then go through structured stages such as design, implementation, and deployment. Later, the system might be updated, modified, or phased out entirely, depending on organizational needs, technology shifts, or operational performance.</p></p>
            <h3>A Deeper Look at Life Cycles and Their Parts</h3>
            <p>Each life cycle is made up of stages, representing distinct periods in a system’s evolution. Common stages include planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. While these may seem linear at a glance, they often include iterative loops or branching decision points, especially in complex systems where changes in one area impact others.</p>
               <p>The life cycle model determines the order and structure of how these stages are executed. In contrast, the life cycle itself simply identifies what the stages are. Understanding this distinction is important: the model defines behavior, while the life cycle defines structure.</p>
               <p>According to Sandra Furterer in the book <em>Systems Engineering: Holistic Life Cycle Architecture Modeling and Design with Real-World Applications</em>, there are three main categories of life cycle models: waterfall, evolutionary, and agile. The waterfall model follows a linear sequence. The evolutionary model delivers functionality in increments. The agile model builds functionality in repeated spirals, allowing for continuous refinement.</p>
               <p>This framework applies whether you’re developing a physical product, a software system, or a set of technical documents. Thinking in terms of life cycles ensures that what you're creating is designed to be maintained, adapted, and sustained over time. It encourages a shift from short-term delivery to long-term usability, traceability, and change management.</p>
            <h3>The Technical Writing Life Cycle
            </h3>
            <p>Technical writing follows a similar pattern. A documentation project evolves through defined stages: planning, content requirements, drafting, review, publication, maintenance, and eventually archival.
               </p>
               <p>In the planning stage, writers assess documentation needs based on product goals or user input. In content requirements, they define what should be documented, which formats to use, and how to organize the content. The drafting and review stages involve writing, revising, and gathering feedback from subject matter experts. Publication delivers the content in its final form, through portals, PDFs, or in-product help. Maintenance keeps content aligned with product changes, and archival occurs when the documentation is outdated or the product is discontinued.
               </p>
               <p><b>Just like systems engineering, the life cycle model applied, linear, iterative, or incremental, shapes how the documentation is created and maintained:
               </b></p>
               <ul>
                  <li><b>Linear model:</b> Works well for fixed-scope documents such as regulatory manuals.</li>
                  <li><b>Iterative model:</b> Supports continuous feedback and revision, ideal for documentation tied to Agile development.</li>
                  <li><b>Incremental model:</b> Allows content to be delivered in prioriti
                     zed chunks and expanded over time.</li>
                </ul>
                
                  <p>Each model has strengths and limitations. Linear models are predictable but inflexible. Iterative models improve quality but may demand more coordination. Incremental models deliver value early but can create cohesion issues if not carefully managed.
                  </p>
                  <p>Understanding technical writing as a life cycle reinforces the idea that documentation must be planned, maintained, and adapted, not just delivered.
                  </p>
      <h3>Comparing Life Cycle Methodologies
      </h3>
      <p>Each life cycle methodology influences how both systems and documentation are developed. The waterfall model, which is linear and predictive, supports detailed early planning and can lead to more predictable cost and schedule estimates. However, it lacks flexibility. Changes to requirements late in the process can introduce major delays, and feedback typically comes late.</p>
       <p>The incremental model offers more flexibility. It’s especially useful when requirements are unclear early on or when parts of a system need to be delivered sooner. Documentation can be released alongside each increment, keeping pace with development. However, each increment functions like a mini-project, adding to costs. It also requires ongoing engagement from stakeholders, which can be difficult to maintain.</p>
      <p>The iterative model builds functionality in repeated cycles. It’s well-suited for projects with evolving goals, where early feedback helps refine both the system and its documentation. Like incremental models, it can be expensive and time-consuming. It also relies heavily on customer involvement and clear communication.       </p>
       <p>Choosing the right model depends on project scope, stability of requirements, and user needs. For technical writers, understanding the model used by the engineering team helps align documentation planning with product development rhythms.      </p>
      
   
            <h3>Clarifying the Vee Model</h3>
            <p>A common misconception is that the Vee Model represents a complete system life cycle. In reality, it does not. The Vee Model is a framework that shows the relationship between development and verification processes within a life cycle; not the life cycle itself.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction because it clarifies the relationship between processes and stages. Each stage contains specific processes, and some processes, like testing or validation, can appear multiple times. This sometimes creates confusion, where people mistake recurring activities for standalone stages.</p>
<p>To address this, the <strong>Life Cycle Ontology</strong> is being expanded to more clearly define how processes operate within each stage. This clarity helps avoid misapplying the Vee Model and ensures teams distinguish between high-level structure and task-level activity.</p>

<h3>Processes vs. Stages in Technical Writing</h3>   
<p>The same distinction applies in technical writing. Projects often include repeatable processes, like editing, reviewing, and publishing, that occur across multiple life cycle stages. For instance, editing can happen during initial drafting, post-review, and even after publication.</p>

  <p>Recognizing this separation prevents overcomplication. Not every task needs to be labeled as its own phase. Instead, teams can structure documentation workflows around major life cycle stages while allowing key processes to support them as needed.</p>

  <p>This distinction supports better planning and keeps documentation projects organized, even across large teams or multi-phase deliverables.</p>

  <p>When you apply life cycle thinking to technical writing, documentation becomes a living system with structure, behavior, and evolution. Just like any system, content must be conceived, developed, used, supported, and eventually retired.</p>

  <p>Here’s how that maps out:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conception:</strong> Identify documentation needs, define the audience, and establish success criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Development:</strong> Plan, write, and review content with SMEs and stakeholders.</li>
  <li><strong>Utilization:</strong> Publish and deliver content through the appropriate channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Support and Maintenance:</strong> Update based on product changes, user feedback, or version releases.</li>
  <li><strong>Retirement:</strong> Archive or deprecate outdated documentation as systems change or products sunset.</li>
</ul>

<p>This model is especially valuable in Agile, cloud-based, and regulated environments, where product development never truly ends. Documentation must scale and adapt in tandem.</p>

<h3>Navigating Overlapping Life Cycles</h3>
<p>Technical writing teams often operate within multiple overlapping life cycles. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The project life cycle:</strong> Sets delivery timelines.</li>
  <li><strong>The procurement life cycle:</strong> Affects how writing tools or services are acquired.</li>
  <li><strong>The technology life cycle:</strong> Impacts content platforms, especially when tools become outdated.</li>
</ul>

<p>When writing is tied to long-term software systems or third-party platforms, these external cycles affect how and when content must be revised. Documentation must reflect shifts in tools, user interfaces, compliance needs, and even company structure over time.</p>

<p>Understanding these intersections helps writers make strategic content decisions that extend beyond the immediate release.</p>

<h3>Documentation as a Living System</h3>
<p>In short, documentation isn't just something we publish—it’s something we maintain. Treating it as a living system with its own life cycle supports long-term sustainability, helps teams manage complexity, and keeps content aligned with evolving product and user needs.</p>

<p>This approach is essential when working on complex digital systems, especially those used in regulated industries or long-term platforms. Life cycle thinking allows writing teams to stop asking, “What do we write?” and instead focus on, “How do we keep this useful and relevant for years to come?”</p>
