    <h1>My name is Osman Turhan Kalayci</h1>
    <p>I played semi-professional soccer for most of my life in Turkey and Belgium before moving to the United States of America. I am currently looking to get a Cybersecurity degree from Central Washington University after getting my associate degree in Criminal Justice, it is quite a change in career, but I feel like I would do extremely well in the Information Technology field.</p>
    <h2>My portfolio; Personal blogs about Abstracting Systems, Designing for People, and Designing Experiences, and Design Challenges on Figma</h2>
    <p><p>This portfolio shows my work across several UX design challenges and blog assignments completed while enrolled in IT 312, Designing Digital Environments. From conceptual blog posts on human-centered design to interactive prototypes like the DoorDash user journey, each piece reflects my evolving skills in usability, interface logic, and ethical digital design. Together, they represent my transition from a career in criminal justice and athletics to a future in cybersecurity and information technology professional.</p></p>
