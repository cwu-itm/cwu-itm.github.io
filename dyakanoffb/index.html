            <h3>Defining Systems Thinking Introduction</h3>
            <p>When it comes to approaching anything in life, a challenge, a job any sort of product or just about anything else you can think of there are many different strategies you can take in order to do what youre set out to do, this can be simple like completing a daily task or a complex project that will affect many people and require a large scale approach. All these are a part of some sort of system that contain different elements that are impacted and directly or indirectly affected by another. This is why its important to understand different ways of thinking depending on what you are working with and especially in the technology field having a system way of thinking is crucial to ensure that what is being worked on is able to fit in the larger system at play and not affect any other stakeholders negatively in the process.</p>
            <h3>What is System Thinking?</h3>
            <p>To start this process it's important to understand what system thinking is, and while it does have many definitions and meanings to many different people it mostly depends on who you ask and how it affects them personally, how they have learned to think about their system and what key details are important to them. A personal definition that I'd say would be, “A group of systematic elements defined by a set boundary in a direct relationship amongst each other to achieve a larger goal.” And while this definition can lack many details depending on what sort of category of system we are talking about or who you ask I believe that this is a good general definition of how most systems work as there are many. You can think of these systems sort of like an onion, the outside skin is your boundary and the overall system you are looking at is like a game system outer shell containing all the electronic elements inside of it. But the deeper you get in that onion or system the more elements you see that have a unique relationship that is built on each other to achieve something bigger than them. There is no one element that is individual; everything is a cog in the overall picture of that system. But a games console is not just a system, every part about life is a part of an overall system thinking. Nature is a system thinking like how rain, and seasons can affect environments and how food chains of these environments are systems of their own, where if one animal leaves that chain for example that system can break (Holt, 2021). All these are a part of a system thinking approach and all these stakeholders and aspects are something that need to be thought of when creating a project or making a new product for example.</p>
            <h3>System Thinking vs Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>This is contrasting to what most people are used to which is with the use of linear thinking, where system thinking looks at the larger picture and what is being effected and what could happen a linear way of thinking is more straightforward. You have a start and you have a goal and the linear thinking approach is about getting to that goal as efficiently and effectively as you can going from step to step and not straying off the beaten path. And can be useful for daily and repeatable tasks that wont be negatively affected by this approach it's a good way to manage something with predictable outcomes and confidence in what youre doing by taking knowledge from the past and repeating it now as others already have taken the time to understand that this way of thinking is the most productive for your task or to reach that specific goal(Dix, 2016). So this can be a very useful way of thinking but for more complex tasks like creating a complex digital system it quickly falls short of reaching the goal that you want to achieve with these systems and what exactly you're trying to cater to and to whom.</p>
            <h3>But Why System Thinking</h3>
            <p>So this is why systems thinking is preferable in these situations. Continuing the example of creating an advanced digital system, it's crucial to get everything right and plan for any possible scenario while properly ensuring you are reaching your goal with these systems. You can do this quickly with a linear way of thinking and make what you want in these systems but that undermines many different stakeholders that will be a part of this digital system and be personally affected by it. As everybody interacts with these digital systems differently and need to be able to understand each other and properly communicate while creating and using these systems are they will all eventually fall apart, highlighting a level of understanding so that any stakeholder in many different kinds of backgrounds can be a part of this system effectively is a crucial part of this systems thinking process. This is important because the main thing about systems thinking is that it helps everyone manage their different perspectives on a given topic and the ability to bring these all together to achieve something as this is how we solve any problem that is thrown at us in this world (Morganelli, 2024). This is how societies function with these complex systems and how humans, animals and nature alike get through their lives and achieve the goals they need to accomplish. With the stakeholders that are affected by it, abiding by the potential constraints that there is usually many of when creating these systems and for them to properly function as well as what elements are a part of this system and the attributes each of these elements provide for the overall system set by its boundary physical or conceptual as it not just a straight line its much harder to comprehend much very important if you can.</p>
            <h3>Model based approach to system thinking</h3>
            <p>But what is a good way of comprehending it? You can make an endless list of things that could be affected in a system or that is required or what your constraints are but how can these best be visualized or understood. And how can you best know where to stop, where the boundaries of this system are? A good way to handle this issue is with a model-based approach, applying this to a complex digital system. A model based approach helps us visual and understand what is connected to what in this complex way of system thinking. It's an important way to understand our boundaries and everything in the middle to see what is needed, and what is being effected and this is the starting point for any sort of digital system like how a phone would have blueprints in the beginning or a concept design that is the model of the phone and what the designers want in the boundaries they sit within that device. This is a crucial part of this process and helps prevent things from getting out of control as it can quickly become in the system thinking process and identifying any stakeholders or goal.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall system thinking is an important part of building new and unique systems around the world and understanding how they work on many different levels, this not only helps us categorize and identify how these processes work but how to make them efficient and useful to all stakeholders involved in these systems, it's a vital part of how we function and is a complex but unique and interesting concept that helps those see more than whats in front of them when being apart of these daily systems or how we will create more of them in the future.</p>

            <h3>Introduction to life cycles</h3>
            <p>With any product or service around the world, they go through many phases of their life. From the concept of this product or service to the end of its functional life with the retirement and disposal of these things. This is how many systems and concepts in life go about, through these life cycles and gives us a complex and detailed understanding of what these systems will go through during their life. And gives those creating these products as well as the stakeholders that use and manufacture these products an idea of what lies ahead, creating curiosity for the future and a glimpse and preparation of what is to come in the future.  This is the importance of life cycles and is a crucial part to understanding all sorts of systems, but today we will be focusing on digital systems and the stages they go through in their life cycle from beginning to end. Showing how we can use these cycles to continue to modernize and advance technology while preparing for past digital systems to die away and become outdated and old by technological standards.</p>
            <h3>Defining the systems development life cycle</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of different definitions for a systems development life cycle as there are many elements to it. But a good general definition is the evolution of a system through different stages of its development. This is a short and compact definition but serves as a general look at what these life cycles entail but it's important to understand the details of a system life cycle and then what the development stage of this life cycle would look like in particular. Focusing on technology life cycles the start begins with Research and development. This is where time and money is being invested into this upcoming technology to hopefully make it into a functioning product and a meaningful product in the technology market that appeals to stakeholders, this is where the beginning stages, development and prototyping of this new technology starts. This process then moves into ascent, this is where the technological product is out and its starting to expand. More people and companies are starting to adopt it into their everyday lives and it is starting to become more commonplace around the world, think people moving to music streaming services and moving away from CDs early in the lifecycle of these music services, with more cars and speakers using these as the source of music compared to other alternatives. The next part of this life cycle is maturity this is the stage where it is implemented in many systems, its it well-established and has a foothold in many technological systems but isnt exactly being implemented into new ones as its already in most, it has stabled out and has a flat trend line during this stage. Then finally the technology declines in implementation, it either becomes out of date or is overshadowed by newer more advanced technology and its uses are no longer needed or cant keep up this is where the tech starts to retire and is the end of that technological life cycle (Holt, 2021). Now this was a broad look at these stages and each stage has many more moving parts in them, like disposal, production, maintenance and operation. But the main focus is in the development stage of these digital systems and how they evolve over time.</p>
            <h3>Linear Life Cycle Model</h3>
            <p>For that we can separate development stages from asset stages in these systems life cycle. Development stages focus on a few things, conception, development and production where the technology follows these stages of development to be further implemented and produced into the world but these models arent always linear. There are a few key life cycle models that can be used during this process of developing and producing a product and depending on what your desired outcomes are or what the needs for the product to be successful are can change what kind of life cycle model you follow to determine what sort of lifecycle the product hopes to have. Starting with a very basic model, the linear model. This model follows the evolution of a product from start to finish from one step to the next with little to no room to work around and no way of going back to previous stages to redo, or improve a product. This model is basic and is primarily used for small scale well defined products that wont need multiple iterations, it is easily manageable as you know that once you go past one of these steps you wont have to revisit it and this type of model is usually quick and to the point. While this model is simple to understand and execute for large scale products it is not viable and quickly get overwhelmed or undermines the scale that is required to successfully implement large scale systems and projects to what is expected.</p>
            <h3>Iteration Life Cycle Model</h3>
            <p>For this companies might want something like an iteration life cycle model which is used to great success especially in the software industry. As iteration life cycles focus on getting a product into utilization in a quicker timeframe but constantly going back to the beginning and changing and updating this software or product and repeating the process, with the system getting better each time until the stakeholders get what they want with their product. It is focused on repetitive development cycles that continuously happen and the ability to get a lot of feedback on what is essentially a draft of the final product until it is determined that whatever the latest iteration of the product is, is a success (Harness, 2023). This model is useful as it is expected to be redone over and over again, so even if a stakeholder has some sort of issue with the product there will be no set backs as its expected and there are plans in place so that the product can efficiently go to previous stages to be redone and made better each time, it ensures that nothing is set in stone until there is complete approval which is why this is so popular with software development as developers can easily and quickly redo what they have to do show an altered product with the notes they were given, without spending extra time on areas where they dont need to focus on. And while this is a pro it can also be a con, if those developing the product dont ensure that the various elements of the product can be accurately and quickly changed it can waste a lot of time and resources compared to be prepared for the stakeholder to request a change and for the product to be flexible and altered in a manageable way.</p>
            <h3>Incremental Life Cycle Model</h3>
            <p>A final model that can be followed in the development in digital systems that can be implemented if neither the the previous life cycle models would work for the desired system is an incremental model, this life cycle model is similar to the iteration life cycle model where the product goes back to previous stages in its life cycle to improve over time till the final version is determined and able to properly mature. This kind of model is meant for larger projects as it breaks it down into smaller projects that need to be done, until it becomes an overall final product but unlike the iteration life cycle it only has one concept phase where the overall project is properly outlined, documented and understood so that it can be properly worked on and pushed out over multiple phases. This starts with the most critical features being pushed out first and utilized by stakeholders where it can be used quicker than waiting for the whole development cycle to finish, while giving stakeholders the opportunity to use the product, understand it and give feedback on it while more features continue to be added on (Saxena, 2026). This parallel development while being used system works hand in hand in breaking down these larger projects that this model focuses on and ensuring a longer life cycle while adjusting as needed in practical use cases with early versions of this product, keeping it easy to understand and build upon while stakeholders opinions and education on the system also is built upon. While this is a very useful model some places where it falls short is with its complexity, having a function and running product and system in place while continuously updating and changing it takes a large scale infrastructure and communication among developers to ensure that the desired outcome is being completed on time while also having others ensure the current product that is working as intended even if it is an early iteration of it. Which is why while this is a good model for complex projects it also requires a complex amount of planning and support.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Understanding system life cycles are a crucial part to modeling and understanding these systems before you attempt to design and produce a product, it helps segment and breakdown these complex systems into manageable projects that will later become a final mature system, these models ensure that the system is sustainable and doesn’t use unnecessary resources and time compared to less defined or modeled projects and ensures the these digital systems evolve and stay up to date with what is required with the current level of technology that is constantly changing on a daily basis. Without it these digital systems can quickly become the next CD and be overshadowed by whatever is coming next.</p>

               <h2>Module 2.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Introduction to human-centered design</h3>
            <p>When creating any product or service a crucial part of the early process of this creation is design, but most importantly human-centered design. This makes your product or service intuitive and usable to any person that is trying to functionally use it. The first step of this design process is understanding what it's being used for. To start this you must consider what your customer base is and get their perspective, this can be through interviews or surveys but the main goal is to understand what they are currently doing to solve a specific issue and why, then break down what they are trying to accomplish by doing this (Landry, 2020). This is crucial to human-centered design as it breaks down the pain point that is trying to be eased when making this product and it gets more attention and customers to use the product or service to get what they need from it in an efficient and practical way. To get this practicality you have to continue to use this kind of design philosophy to create a product or service that is easily understandable and memorable to continuous use by various users of different backgrounds and experiences. This kind of usability is based on human psychology that follows various different Laws in how people interact with everyday things and what keeps that coming back contrasted with what pushes them away. For example Jakobs law demonstrates this kind of usability greatly, when designing a product users will have an expectation based on previous experience on how something is designed and what they have learned from the past in order to navigate and use new things (Yablonski, 2024). This is the reason why when you buy a new TV you expect the remote power button to be at the top or the volume to be on the middle right, or when you go to a website you expect the search function if applicable to be on the top right this is because that is what has been previously used and continue to be used on a consistent basis and reduces the amount of information that new consumers have to gather to functionally use a product or service. Without this everything will be new to every consumer every time which confuses and upsets customers that dont understand the design of said product and further creates disconnect with it, reduces the likelihood that itll be used again.</p>
            <h3>Perspective of human-centered design from ISO 9241-210</h3>
            <p>Similar perspectives are shared with the perspectives of ISO 9241-210 and IDEOs Field Guide, while specifics can stray a bit differently compared to others the focus on the human aspect of human-centered design stays the same as humans mainly act and react to things in similar ways that are repeatable and predictable. ISO talks about this matter as this standard is to achieve that design focused on the user is set out to achieve specific goals with needs and requirements that are outlined with the users capabilities and needs to create a practical and useful design for what is trying to be solved in each given scenario. This required strategic perspectives from different scenarios depending on what is being required of the product, for example a software that is designed on marketing to the user or managing customer relationship will be focused on the perspective of a marketing and sales team that is expected prerequisites to their job and what information and data will be required to make these tasks more efficient and understandable to their past experience. And this design process isnt a linear thing as things are constantly being reiterated to specified to fit the requirements that are outlined by the goals of the product to the customer base, this allows for adaptation and managing of different users experiences as this allows things like large application changes to be rolled out in small phases rather than rapidly and in bulk which creates confusion and resentment toward the new and unknown product that the main customer base doesnt understand or it doesnt effectively fit their needs. Effectively implementing these design choices requires responsible roll out, as well as information and feedback that will be effectively used given the resources and time requirement of this change or implementation.</p>
            <h3>Perspective from IDEO</h3>
            <p>On the other hand the IDEO organization focuses on similar qualities but in a bit of a different tone when understanding human-centered design, this begins by understanding what is most desirable of an outcome for people and what they need. By breaking down their hopes and fears you can solve the problems that people are having and figure out what might best help fit their needs be designing a balanced and sustainable product that can fit the needs of all those using it, it can be successful and understandable for all those that are need to use it (IDEO, 2025). Designing this approach requires designers to think out of the box to create things in areas that will solve issues and grow through the issues in a rapidly changing environment to come up with these complex problems that require complex solutions and ideas to solve. Similar to ISO these go through various stages of designing, testing and repurposing and going in circles until there is enough feedback and iterations to create a functional and useful product for those that are needing to use it, fitting the needs of those from all different backgrounds. By getting on peoples levels and understanding the reasons why these issues are occurring or why they need help with these various problems is only then when you can tailor and design a specific solution to these unique and complex issues. While using experience from previous designs and having a baseline of what is being expected or where to begin when tackling these issues it should and will drastically be different then anything else and go off in complex and different directions then what is previous expected and that is the point with there being billions of people you have billions of complex minds and problems that require going out of comfort zones and learning more about them to be successful.</p>
            <h3>Visual hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Going back to the ideas of design laws in the creation of these products and services the idea of a visual hierarchy becomes ever more important in designing these products that users are actively using and interacting with and how it is understandable and convenient for everyone to interact with for example what captures the attention of people first and what is easily understandable so that users can accomplish the task they are set out to do, or how various elements are grouped together or might be too cluttered. These are all aspects of a visual hierarchy and determine how users interact with these different elements as something that is bold and colorful will grab the attention of most users compared to bland, subtle and cluttered elements that only few users will immediately interact with which can decide what is most important on a product to ensure more users immediately go to that instead of being overwhelmed with many different elements that look the same or aren’t visually identifiable (Interaction design, 2025). This topic is also known as Fitt’s Law this law highlights the importance of an object in a product with how it looks, the size of it, where its positioned for example somebody holding a phone with one hand will have limited movement with their thumb so objects that are more towards the bottom or middle of the phone will be interacted with more and wont cause more frustration so this area should be focused on important buttons or the main focus on the product or service. This also goes with visual elements that are memorable like shapes and colors, like how you dont read every app on your phone most people find the icon that fits with what their memory is used to associated with the application they want to access and press on that, sort of why people still call X, Twitter. As thats that association that has built in their memory of many years. Other laws that are associated with these user designs are the amount of content that is being shown to the user and the visual distinction that is made to ensure that no further confusion is created. This is also known as Millers Law and it proves that humans can only retain and occupy a limited amount of information at a time and this is best memorized in terms of chunking the information into groups. This is why websites arent one large chunk of text or why a phone number isn’t one large group of numbers because it’s difficult to remember and associate with many people. Segmenting different topics or information ensures people can retain that information moving forward and can come back knowing where to go for what they need. Similar to this is Hicks Law which is the focus on how quickly people can react in time given the amount of information they are shown as a limited and smaller amount of information reduces the amount of decisions that people have to make and increases engagement as they arent stuck trying to figure different things out over time, this is why it takes so long to find a show on Netflix compared to knowing how to search something on Google, where one has a lot of options of different genres and length the other has one main function at the center of your screen being the largest thing there.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, humans are very complex and because of this designers have to be complex and deliberate with how things are created, understanding what is trying to be accomplished then designing the product in a way that promoted repetition and memorization is the key to successful design of something and which is what makes it useful and what gives people a reason to come back. By using these laws and philosophies designers can understand what works and branch off from there to create something new and unique to solve the world's constantly evolving new and unique issues.</p>
