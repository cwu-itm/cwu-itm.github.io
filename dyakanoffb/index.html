            <h3>Defining Systems Thinking Introduction</h3>
            <p>When it comes to approaching anything in life, a challenge, a job any sort of product or just about anything else you can think of there are many different strategies you can take in order to do what youre set out to do, this can be simple like completing a daily task or a complex project that will affect many people and require a large scale approach. All these are a part of some sort of system that contain different elements that are impacted and directly or indirectly affected by another. This is why its important to understand different ways of thinking depending on what you are working with and especially in the technology field having a system way of thinking is crucial to ensure that what is being worked on is able to fit in the larger system at play and not affect any other stakeholders negatively in the process.</p>
            <h3>What is System Thinking?</h3>
            <p>To start this process it's important to understand what system thinking is, and while it does have many definitions and meanings to many different people it mostly depends on who you ask and how it affects them personally, how they have learned to think about their system and what key details are important to them. A personal definition that I'd say would be, “A group of systematic elements defined by a set boundary in a direct relationship amongst each other to achieve a larger goal.” And while this definition can lack many details depending on what sort of category of system we are talking about or who you ask I believe that this is a good general definition of how most systems work as there are many. You can think of these systems sort of like an onion, the outside skin is your boundary and the overall system you are looking at is like a game system outer shell containing all the electronic elements inside of it. But the deeper you get in that onion or system the more elements you see that have a unique relationship that is built on each other to achieve something bigger than them. There is no one element that is individual; everything is a cog in the overall picture of that system. But a games console is not just a system, every part about life is a part of an overall system thinking. Nature is a system thinking like how rain, and seasons can affect environments and how food chains of these environments are systems of their own, where if one animal leaves that chain for example that system can break (Holt, 2021). All these are a part of a system thinking approach and all these stakeholders and aspects are something that need to be thought of when creating a project or making a new product for example.</p>
            <h3>System Thinking vs Linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>This is contrasting to what most people are used to which is with the use of linear thinking, where system thinking looks at the larger picture and what is being effected and what could happen a linear way of thinking is more straightforward. You have a start and you have a goal and the linear thinking approach is about getting to that goal as efficiently and effectively as you can going from step to step and not straying off the beaten path. And can be useful for daily and repeatable tasks that wont be negatively affected by this approach it's a good way to manage something with predictable outcomes and confidence in what youre doing by taking knowledge from the past and repeating it now as others already have taken the time to understand that this way of thinking is the most productive for your task or to reach that specific goal(Dix, 2016). So this can be a very useful way of thinking but for more complex tasks like creating a complex digital system it quickly falls short of reaching the goal that you want to achieve with these systems and what exactly you're trying to cater to and to whom.</p>
            <h3>But Why System Thinking</h3>
            <p>So this is why systems thinking is preferable in these situations. Continuing the example of creating an advanced digital system, it's crucial to get everything right and plan for any possible scenario while properly ensuring you are reaching your goal with these systems. You can do this quickly with a linear way of thinking and make what you want in these systems but that undermines many different stakeholders that will be a part of this digital system and be personally affected by it. As everybody interacts with these digital systems differently and need to be able to understand each other and properly communicate while creating and using these systems are they will all eventually fall apart, highlighting a level of understanding so that any stakeholder in many different kinds of backgrounds can be a part of this system effectively is a crucial part of this systems thinking process. This is important because the main thing about systems thinking is that it helps everyone manage their different perspectives on a given topic and the ability to bring these all together to achieve something as this is how we solve any problem that is thrown at us in this world (Morganelli, 2024). This is how societies function with these complex systems and how humans, animals and nature alike get through their lives and achieve the goals they need to accomplish. With the stakeholders that are affected by it, abiding by the potential constraints that there is usually many of when creating these systems and for them to properly function as well as what elements are a part of this system and the attributes each of these elements provide for the overall system set by its boundary physical or conceptual as it not just a straight line its much harder to comprehend much very important if you can.</p>
            <h3>Model based approach to system thinking</h3>
            <p>But what is a good way of comprehending it? You can make an endless list of things that could be affected in a system or that is required or what your constraints are but how can these best be visualized or understood. And how can you best know where to stop, where the boundaries of this system are? A good way to handle this issue is with a model-based approach, applying this to a complex digital system. A model based approach helps us visual and understand what is connected to what in this complex way of system thinking. It's an important way to understand our boundaries and everything in the middle to see what is needed, and what is being effected and this is the starting point for any sort of digital system like how a phone would have blueprints in the beginning or a concept design that is the model of the phone and what the designers want in the boundaries they sit within that device. This is a crucial part of this process and helps prevent things from getting out of control as it can quickly become in the system thinking process and identifying any stakeholders or goal.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall system thinking is an important part of building new and unique systems around the world and understanding how they work on many different levels, this not only helps us categorize and identify how these processes work but how to make them efficient and useful to all stakeholders involved in these systems, it's a vital part of how we function and is a complex but unique and interesting concept that helps those see more than whats in front of them when being apart of these daily systems or how we will create more of them in the future.</p>
