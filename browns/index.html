            <h3>Defining Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>The purpose of systems thinking is to analyze data collected for any systems engineering project being facilitated. This is done by identifying the system’s attributes, concepts, constraints, stakeholders, and needs. By examining how these elements interact rather than treating them independently, systems thinking enables engineers to better understand overall system behavior and performance. As stated in the reading from the text, “Fundamentally, there are three types of causes for failures: communication, complexity, and understanding” (Holt, 2021). These causes are especially prevalent in large-scale or digital systems where multiple subsystems, teams, and technologies must work together seamlessly. Systems thinking aims to mitigate these failure drivers by promoting shared understanding, improving communication across disciplines, and managing complexity through holistic analysis. This is accomplished by ensuring consistency and alignment across every system concept, requirement, and attribute that is enabled throughout the lifecycle.</p>
            <p>In another article, Using Systems Thinking to Illustrate Digital Business Model Innovation, the authors state that “systems thinking is a transdisciplinary perspective which enables complex and multidimensional environmental, social, and organizational real-world situations to unfold and be tackled” (Kurti et al., 2021). This perspective is particularly valuable in modern systems engineering, where technical decisions are tightly coupled with organizational, operational, and user considerations. Monitoring all aspects of issues, projects, or plans, with the understanding that every part influences the whole, enables engineers to anticipate unintended consequences and emergent behaviors. As a result, systems thinking supports more robust decision-making, reduces integration risk, and enhances the likelihood that complex systems will meet stakeholder needs and perform as intended. Linear thinking tends to be more step-by-step, following a path to a solution, one component at a time. This kind of thinking is useful for smaller, less important issues that need a resolution. Systems thinking focuses more on how the issue is affecting the system as a whole and what changing it would look like across all aspects of the system. Traditional thinking might solve the problem and meet the basic requirements of an issue, but systems thinking offers a new perspective on the issue and meets the requirements while adding features that may have been identified in other areas of the system.</p>
            <h3>Traditional and Linear Thinking vs. Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>Linear thinking tends to be more step-by-step, following a direct path to a solution by addressing each component in turn. This kind of thinking is often effective for smaller, well-defined problems with limited interactions and straightforward resolution. In these cases, cause-and-effect relationships are usually clear, and changes made to one element have minimal impact on other parts of the system. Because of this, linear thinking is commonly used in traditional engineering tasks where requirements are stable, and the scope of the problem is narrow.</p>
            <p>Systems thinking, on the other hand, focuses on how an issue affects the system as a whole and how changes to one element influence other components, processes, and stakeholders. Rather than isolating a single problem, systems thinking examines interdependencies, feedback loops, and potential ripple effects across the entire system. While traditional thinking may successfully solve an immediate problem and meet basic requirements, it can overlook secondary impacts that emerge during integration or operation. Systems thinking offers a broader perspective by identifying these hidden interactions and addressing them early in the design process. This approach not only meets the original requirements but also enables the identification of additional needs, risks, or opportunities in other areas of the system. As a result, systems thinking supports more robust, adaptable, and sustainable solutions, particularly in complex systems where long-term performance and reliability are critical.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Approaches for Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>A model-based approach is effective for digital systems because it provides a structured set of tools and techniques that support system development from concept through deployment and sustainment. This approach enables engineers to create visual and analytical representations of system requirements, architecture, behavior, and interfaces, allowing complex information to be understood and communicated more clearly. By using models as the primary source of information, teams can rigorously manage the various complexities inherent in digital systems, including software–hardware interactions, data flows, cybersecurity considerations, and performance constraints. Additionally, a model-based approach supports the identification and management of interdependencies and changes that may occur throughout the system’s life cycle, making it easier to assess the impacts of design decisions before implementation.</p>
            <p>The article Optimizing early-stage efficiency in complex system development via model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and concurrent engineering (CE) integration emphasizes that a model-based approach improves the management of complexity, enhances design integration, and reduces risk in complex engineered systems (Vizitiu et al., 2021). By enabling early analysis, simulation, and validation, MBSE helps uncover inconsistencies and design flaws before they become more costly to resolve. The benefits of using MBSE include efficiency gains, improved multidisciplinary collaboration, enhanced requirements traceability, reduced risk and error, and broader application across multiple domains. Together, these advantages make a model-based approach particularly well suited for modern digital systems, where complexity, change, and integration challenges are constant.</p>
