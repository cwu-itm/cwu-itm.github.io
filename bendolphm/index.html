<P>Welcome back to another blog post with your host... Marius Bendolph! It was an interesting week; A "super flu" followed by a stomach bug going around, a 3 day weekend, and feeling like its still Christmas time? It really is an interesting week, but not as interesting as our section .2 in module 1. Let's get into it, i'll fill you in!</P>
          <P><strong>20JAN2026</strong></P>
          <h1>1.2 Blog Post: Thinking in Life Cycles</h1>
          <p>
            In systems engineering, a “life cycle” is not just a timeline, it’s a way of organizing decisions about requirements, design, 
            verification/validation, deployment, and sustainment so the system remains useful over time. The model you choose shapes how your
            team handles uncertainty, how quickly you can learn from real-world feedback, and how painful (or manageable) change becomes.
            In <em>Systems Engineering Demystified</em>, Holt emphasizes that life cycles are essential for understanding how systems evolve,
            but they are often oversimplified in practice because real systems are complex and interconnected (Holt, 2023).
         </p>

         <p>
            This post compares three common life cycle models: <strong>linear</strong>, <strong>iterative</strong>, and <strong>incremental</strong> and
            explains when each makes sense. I also connect Holt’s explanations to two widely recognized external references: the
            ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 standard for system life cycle processes (ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2015) and the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook
            (NASA, 2016). The goal is not to “pick a winner,” but to understand what each model optimizes for and what tradeoffs you accept
            when you commit to it.
         </p>

         <h2>Why life cycle thinking matters more than it sounds</h2>

         <p>
            The easiest mistake to make is to treat a life cycle model like a checklist. In reality, a life cycle model is a strategy for
            managing risk. It sets expectations about when you lock decisions, when you can revisit assumptions, and how you prove that the
            system is ready to move forward. Holt points out that in real organizations, systems often involve multiple life cycles happening
            at the same time, with interaction points that may shift or appear unexpectedly (Holt, 2023). That means a model that looks
            “clean” on paper can fail in practice if it doesn’t match the system’s environment and stakeholder behavior.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Another reason life cycle thinking matters: <em>systems are not isolated</em>. A system is made of interconnected elements within a
            boundary, and it interacts with its environment through interfaces (Holt, 2023). Those interfaces may exchange information,
            energy, materials, money, or combinations of these, and complex systems can have many interfaces and internal interactions.
            When you choose a life cycle model, you are also choosing how you will discover, define, and control those interfaces over time
            (Holt, 2023).
         </p>

         <h2>The basic life cycle “stages”</h2>
         
         <p>
            Holt describes life cycles using stages (such as concept, development, production, and utilization) that represent the kinds of
            activities a system typically goes through from idea to real-world use (Holt, 2023). The three models in this post arrange those
            stages differently and repeat them in different ways.
         </p>
         
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Concept</strong>: define the problem, stakeholders, and what “success” means.</li>
            <li><strong>Development</strong>: shape the solution, design the architecture, and reduce uncertainty.</li>
            <li><strong>Production</strong>: build/implement the system elements and integrate them.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilization</strong>: operate the system in the real environment and learn from performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainment &amp; retirement</strong>: maintain, update, and eventually dispose/replace the system when needed.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>
            ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 frames similar work using defined process groups and technical processes that apply across a system’s life
            (ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2015). NASA also treats systems engineering as an activity that spans the full life cycle rather than a single
            “phase” you finish and forget (NASA, 2016). This matters because life cycle models are ultimately about <strong>when</strong> and
            <strong>how</strong> you apply those processes to guide decisions.
         </p>
         
         <h2>Model #1: Linear life cycle (clear phases, controlled transitions)</h2>
         
         <p>
            A linear model moves through the stages in a mostly one-way flow. The basic idea is simple; do concept work, then development,
            then production, then utilization. Linear approaches are attractive when the system is short, well-defined, and unlikely to face
            major requirement changes. The “best case” is a stable environment where stakeholders agree early, requirements can be
            documented clearly, and the system’s interfaces and constraints can be managed without constant redesign (Holt, 2023).
         </p>
         
         <h3>Strengths of linear approaches</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: everyone knows what stage the project is in and what deliverables are expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Control</strong>: reviews and gates can enforce discipline before the team moves forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Auditability</strong>: documentation and traceability are easier to maintain in regulated contexts.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h3>Weaknesses of linear approaches</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Change is expensive</strong>: late discoveries often trigger rework across multiple stages.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback arrives late</strong>: you may not find real-world usability or integration issues until deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>False certainty</strong>: a “complete” requirements set early on can be an illusion when stakeholders learn over time.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>
            In other words, the linear model tends to work best when uncertainty is already low, or when constraints demand strict control.
            If uncertainty is high, the linear model can create brittle plans that look confident until reality forces change.
         </p>
         
         <h2>Model #2: Iterative life cycle (repeat the stages to learn faster)</h2>
         
         <p>
            Holt describes iterative life cycles as an approach built on a practical assumption; if a linear model works for small,
            well-defined projects, you can break a large complex system into a series of shorter, simpler “mini life cycles,” called
            iterations (Holt, 2023). Each iteration passes through the stages and produces a workable version of the final system that can
            be deployed in the target environment (Holt, 2023).
         </p>
         <p>
            The iteration-by-iteration idea changes how teams think. Instead of betting everything on a single final delivery, the team
            treats each iteration as a learning opportunity. Holt notes a key benefit: each release is typically more complete and improved
            compared to the previous one, and if a release is a disaster, it can be easier to revert to a prior version and restore
            functionality (Holt, 2023).
         </p>
         
         <h3>Advantages of iterative approaches</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Earlier feedback</strong>: you learn from real use sooner, not at the end.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk reduction</strong>: you can detect integration or performance issues earlier.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous improvement</strong>: each cycle refines requirements and design based on evidence.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h3>Real-world cautions Holt emphasizes</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Schedule-driven releases</strong>: Holt points out that in software contexts, iterative cycles may push teams to ship on time
               rather than wait for something that truly works (Holt, 2023).
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Stakeholder volatility</strong>: iterative approaches can invite frequent changes in basic needs, so a robust needs process is
               critical and often missing (Holt, 2023).
            </li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>
            A common misconception is that iterative delivery conflicts with Model-Based Systems Engineering. Holt explicitly rejects this:
            MBSE can be applied wherever you need to control complexity, define understanding, and communicate with stakeholders (Holt, 2023).
            That’s a major point: iteration does not remove the need for disciplined engineering; it increases the need for strong models,
            traceability, and well-defined interfaces because you are making changes more frequently.
         </p>

         <h2>Model #3: Incremental life cycle</h2>
         
         <p>
            Holt explains that the incremental model is similar to the iterative model in that the system is delivered through multiple
            passes and multiple releases both are often grouped as “evolutionary” models (Holt, 2023). The difference is the structure:
            in an incremental approach, the concept stage covers <em>all</em> needs up front, but later development and production focus on
            subsets of needs to produce a partial solution that can be deployed (Holt, 2023).
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Put simply, iterative development often emphasizes refining the same overall product repeatedly, while incremental delivery
            emphasizes expanding capability by delivering chunks of the overall system. Holt highlights an important advantage: the system
            can be seen working earlier, even if deployed in reduced form compared to the final system (Holt, 2023). That can be valuable
            when stakeholders need operational capability sooner, or when you want early “proof of value” while you continue building.
         </p>
         
         <h3>Strengths of incremental approaches</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Early operational value</strong>: stakeholders get usable capability sooner.</li>
            <li><strong>Funding and support</strong>: visible progress can help sustain organizational buy-in.</li>
            <li><strong>Focused scope per release</strong>: teams can isolate complexity into manageable delivery blocks.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h3>Weaknesses of incremental approaches</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Integration burden</strong>: each new increment must integrate cleanly with what already exists.</li>
            <li><strong>Architecture pressure</strong>: early decisions must support future increments, or growth becomes painful.</li>
            <li><strong>Interface creep</strong>: partial deployments can multiply interfaces and operational constraints.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h2>Life cycle models in real systems: interfaces, boundaries, and “multiple life cycles”</h2>
         
         <p>
            The reason life cycles become complicated is that systems interact. Holt defines a system as a set of interconnected elements
            inside a boundary, and emphasizes that interfaces are the connections between the system and its environment (Holt, 2023).
            In practice, those interfaces are where many projects struggle, especially when multiple organizations, suppliers, or legacy
            systems are involved.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Holt also warns that the “single life cycle diagram” is often not the full story. Large organizations may run multiple life cycles
            simultaneously for different subsystems, and those life cycles may intersect at critical points (Holt, 2023). That explains why
            teams can feel like they are “doing iterative development” while their acquisition or governance structure forces linear gates.
            Life cycle alignment is not only a technical issue, it’s organizational.
         </p>
         
         <h2>Processes across the life cycle: why verification and validation can’t be an afterthought</h2>
         
         <p>
            Chapter 5 shifts from life cycle models to the processes that make systems engineering work. Holt says processes lie at the heart
            of systems engineering because systems engineering is an approach to realizing successful systems (Holt, 2023). In other words,
            life cycle models are the “shape,” but processes are the “engine” that moves the work forward.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Holt also lists desirable process properties. One clearly stated property is that processes must be <strong>repeatable</strong>,
            meaning they can be executed consistently by stakeholders (Holt, 2023). Repeatability matters because when teams are large,
            distributed, or working with suppliers, “how we do things” must be stable enough to produce reliable outcomes.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Holt uses ISO 15288 as a concrete example and describes process groups including Agreement, Organizational Project-Enabling,
            Technical Management, and Technical Processes (Holt, 2023). Within the technical processes, ISO 15288 includes activities such as
            stakeholder needs and requirements, system requirements, architecture definition, design definition, implementation, integration,
            verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and disposal (Holt, 2023; ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2015).
         </p>
         
         <h3>Verification vs. validation: A difference that affects every life cycle model </h3>
         
         <p>
            ISO 15288 (as summarized by Holt) distinguishes verification and validation in a way that directly connects to life cycle models:
         </p>
         
         <dl>
            <dt><strong>Verification</strong></dt>
            <dd>
               Providing objective evidence that a system (or system element) fulfills its specified needs (Holt, 2023).
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Validation</strong></dt>
            <dd>
               Providing objective evidence that the system, when in use, fulfills its intended purpose in its intended operational environment
               (Holt, 2023).
            </dd>
         </dl>
         
         <p>
            That distinction is one reason iterative and incremental models can be powerful: they can deliver earlier chances to validate in
            the real environment. But it’s also why those models can fail if teams focus only on shipping increments without maintaining
            disciplined verification and requirements traceability.
         </p>
         
         <h2>A practical way to choose between linear, iterative, and incremental</h2>
         
         <p>
            If you are deciding which model makes sense, think in terms of uncertainty and constraints. Holt’s discussion implies that model
            choice should reflect stakeholder behavior, system complexity, and how fast the team needs feedback (Holt, 2023). ISO 15288 and
            NASA both reinforce the idea that systems engineering processes span the life cycle, so the question becomes: <em>how will you
               structure learning and control?</em> (ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2015; NASA, 2016).
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <strong>Assess volatility:</strong> If stakeholder needs are likely to change frequently, iterative/incremental approaches can
                  handle learning better,<em>if</em>, you have a robust needs process (Holt, 2023).
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Assess integration risk:</strong> If interfaces and integration are high-risk, plan for earlier integration and earlier
                  evidence. Incremental delivery can help, but it also creates repeated integration events.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Assess compliance and governance:</strong> If strict gates, audits, or certification dominate, a linear structure may be
                  required, but you can still incorporate iterative learning inside phases (NASA, 2016).
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Plan verification and validation intentionally:</strong> Don’t push validation to the end. Use the model to create
                  opportunities to validate in realistic conditions (Holt, 2023; ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2015).
               </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            
            <p>
               The biggest takeaway from Chapters 3-5 is that life cycle models are not just academic diagrams. They affect how teams think about
               boundaries, interfaces, and change. Holt’s argument that life cycles are often oversimplified is not pessimistic, it is realistic.
               Real systems are built inside organizations, connected to environments, and shaped by stakeholders who learn over time (Holt, 2023).
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Linear models provide clarity and control when uncertainty is low or governance is strict. Iterative models create faster learning
               loops and reduce the risk of betting everything on a single delivery, but they demand strong needs management and disciplined
               engineering. Incremental models deliver capability earlier and build momentum, but they put pressure on architecture and integration.
               No matter the model, the core processes/needs, requirements, architecture, design, integration, verification, validation,
               operations, maintenance, and disposal still matter, and standards like ISO 15288 and guidance like NASA’s handbook exist because
               consistent process execution is what turns complexity into outcomes (Holt, 2023; ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2015; NASA, 2016).

               <h1>Designing for People: Human-Centered Design (HCD) Starts With Perception</h1>
               <p>
                  Designing for people means more than creating interfaces that look visually appealing it means understanding how humans
                  perceive, process, and interact with information. Human-centered design (HCD) puts users at the center of the design
                  process by considering their cognitive limits, expectations, and emotional needs. When designers account for
                  perception, attention, and empathy early in the design process, they create systems that feel intuitive rather than
                  frustrating. This post explains what it means to “design for people,” compares the perspectives of ISO 9241-210 and

            <h2>What Does Human-Centered Design Mean?</h2>
            <p>
               Human-centered design is an approach that prioritizes the needs, abilities, and limitations of users throughout the
               entire design lifecycle. Instead of designing for ideal conditions, HCD acknowledges real-world human behavior;
               distraction, limited attention, memory constraints, and learned expectations. ISO 9241-210 describes a human-centered
               process that emphasizes understanding users, involving them throughout design, iterating based on evaluation, and
               improving the user experience holistically (International Organization for Standardization [ISO], 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
               In practice, HCD is not just “nice to have”, it is the difference between an interface that feels self-explanatory
               and one that feels like a puzzle. Empathy is central here; designers must understand not only what users do, but why
               they do it, and what gets in the way. That includes visual perception, attention limits, and the emotional impact of
               friction.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h2>ISO 9241-210 vs. IDEO’s Field Guide</h2>
            <p>
               ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide both promote human-centered design, but they come at it from different angles.
               ISO provides a structured framework focused on usability principles, documentation, and iterative evaluation based on
               user feedback (ISO, 2019). This is especially useful in professional, enterprise, or regulated environments where
               repeatable process and measurable outcomes matter.
            </p>
            <p>

               IDEO’s Fiel Guide presents a more flexible, creative toolkit. It emphasizes inspiration, experimentation, and
               storytelling as ways to understand people and uncover needs that users may not state directly. IDEO encourages methods
               like observation, rapid prototyping, and co-creation to learn quickly and refine ideas in real contexts (IDEO, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
               I see these as complementary; ISO helps ensure the design is usable and consistently evaluated, while IDEO’s approach
               helps teams discover deeper motivations and opportunities. When paired, they support both reliability 
               and meaning; It works well and it fits our customers. 
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Perception and Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>
               Humans do not read screens the way we read a book. We scan, we search for patterns, and we rely on visual cues to
               decide what matters first. Visual hierarchy is portrayed by the intentional arrangement of size, contrast, spacing, and position which guides
               attention and reduces effort. When hierarchy is clear, users can quickly answer: “Where am I?” “What can I do?” and
               “What should I click next?”
            </p>
            <p>
               A practical example is a dashboard. If the primary action, such as “Submit,” “Continue,” or “Save”, is visually distinct
               and placed consistently, users can move with confidence. If everything has the same weigh, same button style, similar
               colors, crowded layout, users have to work harder to interpret the interface, which increases cognitive load andfrustration. These are early-stage design choices, and fixing them later is often costly.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Jakob’s Law: People Expect Familiar Patterns</h2>
            <p>
               Jakob’s Law says users spend most of their time on other sites, so they expect your interface to behave similarly
               (Nielsen, 2020). This is basically the “don’t make me learn everything from scratch” principle. Familiar patterns
               reduce friction because users can rely on recognition rather than figuring out a new system.
            </p>
            <p>
               For example, placing a navigation menu in a predictable area (top or left) and using standard labels (“Home,” “About,”
               “Contact”) supports quick orientation. A “creative” navigation layout might look unique, but it can slow users down,
               especially when they are tired, distracted, or task-focused. Human-centered design recognizes that novelty should not
               come at the expense of clarity.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Fitts’s Law: Make Important Targets Easier to Hit</h2>
            <p>
               Fitts’s Law explains that the time required to reach a target depends on its size and distance (Fitts, 1954). In UI
               terms: small buttons and far-away controls are slower and more prone to error, especially on mobile where thumbs and
               touch accuracy are limited.
            </p>
            <p>
               A human-centered design choice is to make primary actions large enough and placed where users naturally reach. Think
               of a “Next” button at the bottom of a phone screen, it’s fast and comfortable. If that button were small, tucked into
               a corner, or too close to other controls, users would misinput more often. This is usability that starts with human
               motor behavior, not just aesthetics.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Hick’s Law: Too Many Choices Slow People Down</h2>
            <p>
               Hick’s Law states that decision time increases with the number of choices available (Hick, 1952). When an interface               throws many options at users at once, it can create decision fatigue. Users may hesitate, pick incorrectly, or abandon
               the task.
            </p>
            <p>
               Human-centered design reduces choice overload by prioritizing options, grouping related actions, and using progressive
               disclosure (showing advanced options only when needed). For example, a clean checkout flow usually highlights one
               primary action. An example of this is a "continue" button which keeps secondary actions less prominent. That supports attention and helps users stay
               on track.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Miller’s Law: Respect Working Memory Limits</h2>
            <p>
               Miller’s Law suggests people can hold only a limited number of items in working memory at once, often cited as about
               seven, plus or minus two (Miller, 1956). When an interface forces users to remember long lists, complex sequences, or
               many categories at once, it increases errors and stress.
            </p>
            <p>
               A human-centered solution is chunking: breaking content into smaller, meaningful groups. Navigation menus, settings
               pages, and forms are all better when items are grouped logically and supported with clear headings. This reduces the
               need to “keep everything in your head” and allows users to focus on completing the task.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How Early Design Choices Support or Hurt Usability</h2>
            <p>
               Early stage design choices (layout, hierarchy, interaction patterns, and content structure) set the direction for the
               entire experience. If the foundation is built around human perception and cognition, usability becomes the natural
               result. If those factors are ignored, usability problems often show up later as “bugs,” “confusing UI,” or “user
               errors.”
            </p>
            <p>
               This is why both ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s Field Guide emphasize iteration: build, test, learn, and refine. ISO frames
               this as an evaluation driven process focused on meeting user needs (ISO, 2019). IDEO frames it as rapid learning
               through prototyping and observation (IDEO, 2015). Either way, the message is similar: usability is not something you
               add at the end, it is something you design from the start.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
               Designing for people requires empathy and an understanding of how people actually perceive and process information.
               Human-centered design helps designers create interfaces that match real human behavior attention span, memory
               constraints, and familiar expectations. ISO 9241-210 provides a structured, evaluative foundation, while IDEO’s Field
               Guide offers flexible tools for discovery and empathy. When designers connect perception and visual hierarchy to UX
               laws like Jakob’s, Fitts’s, Hick’s, and Miller’s, they build experiences that feel intuitive, efficient, and respectful
               of the user.
