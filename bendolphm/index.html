            <!-- FIRST PARAGRAPH -->
            <p>While reading through our first modules' chapters one and two, I already knew id be very excited to start this class! Like every great book, we start with the "lore" of it all, how "Systems Engineering" came to be in our present. Our first note is that Systems Engineering dates back to the 20th Century in Bell laboratories in the USA (Fagen, 1978). But wait a second, what is Systems Engineering and what are Systems? Well "Systems" has a dynamic definition; They are defined in different ways by different, not necessarily a fixed situation. On the bright side, there is a system for this system, designed by Peter Checkland in five separate types; Natural Systems (NS), Designed Physical Systems(DPS), Designed Abstract Systems(DAS), Human Activity Systems(HAS), and last but not least, Transcendental Systems (TS) (Checkland, 1999). As listed, each have their own indicators; Ns are beyond human control, think of natural as in nature; DPS are moreovera limitless amount of items ranging from IoT devices to cars to bridges; DAS are more tailored to one's understanding of an item, object, concept, equation, etc; HAS consists of grouping in efforts to achieve a common goal or purpose, a presidential campaign may qualify; Finally, TS can translate into what is better said as "we dont know what we dont know", information gaps and beyond.</p>
            <!-- SECOND PARAGRAPH -->
            <p>Continuing, Holt frames systems engineering as the work of ensuring that a systems' goals, stakeholder needs, constraints, and technical solutions stay aligned as complexity rises and as teams, suppliers, and technologies multiply (Holt, 2023). This framing matters because it positions systems engineering as a “throughline” from concept to retirement. It also highlights that systems engineering is not limited to one engineering domain; instead, it exists because modern systems demand coordination across mechanical, electrical, software, human factors, operations, sustainment, and management concerns. Holts' definition and scope align with widely used references. INCOSE describes systems engineering as an interdisciplinary approach that enables successful systems by focusing on stakeholder needs early, documenting requirements, and proceeding through design synthesis and validation across the life cycle (Walden et al., 2023). NASA similarly describes systems engineering as a robust approach to design, creation, and operation that links stakeholder expectations, technical baselines, trade studies, and verification activities into one coherent effort (National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 2016). The overlap across Holt, INCOSE, and NASA suggests that the “demystified” view is not a simplified alternative to mainstream systems engineering; it is a practical introduction to the same core commitments: lifecycle thinking, interdisciplinary integration, and explicit management of requirements and interfaces.</p>

             <h3>Systems, Boundaries, and Emergence</h3>
            <p>Holt emphasizes that a “system” is not merely a collection of parts but an organized whole whose behaviour depends on interactions. This leads to the important idea of emergent properties; The system exhibits capabilities and risks that no individual component possesses in isolation (Holt, 2023). For newcomers, the practical implication is that many failures are not “component failures” but “interaction failures.” Integration defects, inconsistent assumptions about timing or data formats, poorly defined interfaces, and unmodeled environmental conditions can cause the overall system to behave unexpectedly even if each component passes its local tests. By highlighting emergence early, Holt motivates why systems engineering must pay attention to system boundaries (what is inside the system of interest, what is external), operating contexts (the environment and usage conditions), and interfaces (where interactions occur).</p>
            <!-- FOURTH PARAGRAPH -->
             <p><strong>The “Evils” Systems Engineering is Meant to Counter</strong></p>
             <p>One of Holts' most memorable teaching tools is his description of the “three evils” that systems engineering seeks to address as follows: complexity, ambiguous communication, and lack of understanding (Holt, 2023). Although other references may use different language, they describe the same underlying problems. Complexity grows with the number of components, the diversity of disciplines, and nonlinear effects of interactions. Ambiguous communication arises when stakeholders use the same words differently or rely on implicit assumptions. Lack of understanding appears when teams are unsure what stakeholders truly need, how the system behaves in context, or what trade offs are being made. Holts' insight is that these problems reinforce each other, complexity increases the chance of misunderstanding, and misunderstanding makes complexity harder to control.</p>
            <p>The most important analytical takeaway from this “three evils” framing is that systems engineering is not merely a checklist of steps. It is a governance mechanism for learning and alignment. INCOSE’s handbook likewise emphasizes disciplined processes and traceability that keep requirements, architecture, verification, and validation connected (Walden et al., 2023). NASA similarly frames systems engineering as decision making under uncertainty—exploring alternatives, managing interfaces, assessing risk, and maintaining a coherent technical baseline as the system matures (NASA, 2016). Holts’ “evils” help explain why those disciplined processes exist: without them, teams tend to build local solutions that do not integrate well, communicate inconsistently across boundaries, and discover fundamental misunderstandings too late, when fixes are expensive.</p>
             <!-- FIFTH PARAGRAPH -->
              <P><strong>Lifecycle Thinking</strong></P>
              <p>Chapter 1 also sets up a dual mandate that appears throughout systems engineering practice. The first step in this process is to build the right system (does it satisfy stakeholder needs in the intended context?) and step 2 is to build the system right (does it satisfy specified requirements and design constraints?). Holts’ early framing makes the point that you cannot validate late stage hardware or software into a fundamentally wrong concept; you must uncover stakeholder intent early and keep it connected to design decisions throughout development (Holt, 2023). NASA’s handbook reinforces this distinction by treating verification and validation as different but complementary activities that should be planned from early phases and performed continuously as the design evolves (NASA, 2016).</p>
            <p>A useful insight here is that requirements are not “paperwork”; they are the bridge between stakeholder intent and engineering decisions. If requirements are unclear, incomplete, or untraceable, then verification becomes a box checking exercise rather than evidence that the system will work. Holts Chapter 1 prepares the reader to see requirements, trade studies, and interface definition as tools for reducing uncertainty and ensuring the team’s understanding remains coherent (Holt, 2023). INCOSE’s handbook similarly stresses that requirements and architecture should be mutually supportive, and that verification evidence must trace back to requirements and stakeholder needs (Walden et al., 2023)</p>
              <!-- SIXTH PARAGRAPH -->
               <p><strong>Why MBSE Changes the Game</strong></p>
               <p>Chapter 2 introduces a strong <strong>“how.”</strong> Holt presents MBSE as a response to document-centric practice that can struggle under scale. A key insight is that natural language documents are often ambiguous and can become inconsistent as systems evolve. When teams rely on many disconnected documents, change propagation is slow, errors hide in gaps between artifacts, and different readers interpret the same text differently. MBSE shifts the technical baseline toward a coherent system model, using structured modelling languages, tools, and methods so that architecture, behaviour, interfaces, requirements relationships, and verification intent remain connected (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>This aligns with a widely used INCOSE definition: MBSE is the formalized application of modelling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification, and validation activities, beginning in conceptual design and continuing through development and later life cycle phases (International Council on Systems Engineering [INCOSE]). The phrase “formalized application” is important because it signals that the model is not just illustrative. Instead, it is part of the controlled technical baseline, managed under configuration control and used for engineering analysis and decision-making. In practical terms, this is like how organizations treat code repositories; The artifacts are controlled, changes are reviewed, and consistency is continuously maintained.</p>
              <!-- SEVENTH PARAGRAPH -->
            <p><strong>Models as a Shared Language </strong></p>
            <p>Holt makes a strong case that modelling is about communication as much as it is about analysis. A well-constructed model provides a shared vocabulary and a structured representation of the system’s logic. Because modelling languages define explicit semantics (for example, how a component relates to an interface or how an activity relates to flows), models reduce the likelihood that two stakeholders interpret the same artifact differently (Holt, 2023). This directly targets one of the “evils” from Chapter 1: ambiguous communication. In a model, relationships are explicit and navigable, and teams can review the same structure rather than trying to reconcile different mental models from separate documents.</p>
            <p>NASA recognizes the same value of models for shared understanding, particularly as systems become more software-intensive and tightly integrated with operations (NASA, 2016). INCOSE also positions MBSE to scale systems engineering by using integrated models to support traceability and analysis across the life cycle (INCOSE; Walden et al., 2023). Holts value add in Chapter 2 is how directly he ties these benefits to everyday frustrations that engineers experience on complex projects: unclear requirements, conflicting diagrams, interface mismatches, and late discovery of assumptions that were never captured explicitly.</p>
            <!-- SEVENTH PARAGRAPH -->
             <p><strong>Managing complexity Through Multiple Consistent Views</strong></p>
             <p>A second core insight is that MBSE helps manage complexity by enabling multiple consistent views of the same underlying model. Rather than maintaining separate artifacts that drift apart, such as a requirements document, a design document, an interface control document, and a test plan, MBSE aims to connect these views via explicit relationships. When done well, a team can answer questions that matter for delivery: Which requirements drive this interface? Which components realize this behaviour? What tests provide evidence for this requirement? What happens to downstream verification if we change this allocation? Holt’s Chapter 2 prepares readers to see MBSE as a way to “thread” these questions through the engineering baseline (Holt, 2023).</p>
            <p>INCOSE emphasizes that traceability and tailoring are essential for applying systems engineering effectively to different project contexts, and MBSE can strengthen traceability by making relationships first-class citizens in the baseline (Walden et al., 2023). NASA likewise emphasizes the importance of managing interfaces and assumptions explicitly as a system matures (NASA, 2016). Hol’ts chapters connect these ideas to a practical claim: complexity is not eliminated by better intentions, but it can be made manageable when the baseline makes dependencies visible and navigable (Holt, 2023).</p>
             <!-- EIGHTH PARAGRAPH -->
             <p><strong>Verification and Validation Embedded in the Modelling Lifecycle</strong></p>
             <p>Holt emphasizes that MBSE is not separate from verification and validation (V&V); rather, V&V can be designed into the model from the start. Early concept models can be used to explore operational scenarios, validate the concept of operations with stakeholders, and identify missing requirements before implementation. As the design becomes more detailed, models can support interface verification planning, simulation, and consistency checks. The larger insight is that MBSE encourages earlier, cheaper learning by shifting discovery left in the life cycle (Holt, 2023).</p>
             <p>NASA’s handbook reflects the same principle: validation of stakeholder expectations and verification planning should begin early and continue as the design evolves, because late stage discovery is costly and risky (NASA, 2016). INCOSE also treats verification and validation as life cycle processes tied to requirements and architecture, and MBSE can strengthen these linkages by tying requirements, design, and evidence together in a single navigable structure (Walden et al., 2023; INCOSE). Holt’s Chapter 2 primes readers to view models as active instruments for V&V rather than passive documentation.</p>
             <!-- NINTH PARAGRAPH -->
              <p><strong>Implementation Insight</strong></p>
              <p>A practical and often underappreciated insight in Holt’s Chapter 2 is that adopting MBSE is not only a tooling decision. Even when teams select a standard modelling language (commonly SysML) and a modelling environment, success depends on people and process: shared conventions, governance, training, review practices, and the discipline to keep the model current as the system evolves (Holt, 2023). Without that discipline, organizations risk producing attractive diagrams that are disconnected from real decisions; an outcome that reproduces document centered failure modes in a new form.</p>
             <p>This point aligns with the broader guidance from NASA and INCOSE, both of which emphasize configuration management, lifecycle governance, and disciplined technical baselines (NASA, 2016; Walden et al., 2023). MBSE changes the artifacts, but it does not eliminate the need for clear roles, review points, and controlled baselines. Holt’s first two chapters implicitly teach that systems engineering methods are only effective when they are embedded in how an organization actually makes decisions, manages change, and learns from evidence.</p>
              <!-- TENTH PARAGRAPH -->
               <p><strong>How Chapters 1 and 2 fit Together </strong></p>
               <p>Read together, Chapters 1 and 2 present a coherent argument. Chapter 1 establishes the problem space: complex systems fail not only due to technical challenges but because teams cannot reliably maintain shared understanding and alignment under complexity (Holt, 2023). Chapter 2 introduces MBSE as a modern response: use formal models to reduce ambiguity, 9 connect views, preserve traceability, and enable earlier verification and validation (Holt, 2023; INCOSE). The key insight is that MBSE does not replace systems engineering fundamentals; it strengthens the ability to practice those fundamentals at scale.</p>
             <p>The strongest takeaway from Holt’s framing is that systems engineering is the discipline of alignment, and MBSE is a particularly powerful set of tools and practices for sustaining alignment through change. When requirements evolve, when design alternatives are traded, and when verification strategies mature, MBSE helps keep the baseline coherent by maintaining explicit relationships among needs, architecture, behaviours, interfaces, and evidence (Holt, 2023). INCOSE and NASA support this direction: systems engineering is fundamentally lifecycle integration, and model-based artifacts can strengthen integration by improving consistency, analysis friendly, and communication across disciplines (Walden et al., 2023; NASA, 2016).</p>
             <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  
             <p>Holt’s first two chapters demystify systems engineering by framing it as the discipline of maintaining understanding and alignment across a system’s life cycle. Chapter 1 explains why systems engineering exists, highlighting complexity, ambiguous communication, and lack of understanding as recurring failure modes that drive cost and schedule risk (Holt, 2023). Chapter 2 explains why MBSE has become central in many domains: by treating a structured system model as a core baseline, teams can reduce ambiguity, manage complexity through consistent views, and integrate verification and validation into engineering work earlier and more continuously (Holt, 2023; INCOSE). Taken together, these chapters provide a practical foundation: systems engineering is not “extra paperwork,” but a way to make complex projects more predictable by making meaning, relationships, and evidence explicit (Walden et al., 2023; NASA, 2016).</p>
