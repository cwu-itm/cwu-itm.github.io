            <h3>What is System Thinking</h3>
            <p>Digital environments and how the user interface is created are a big part of the start of any website being built. From HTML to CSS, all these aspects are decided by how the programmer wants to resolve the issues users may encounter. This is most commonly resolved by systems thinking. Systems thinking is a method of identifying issues in any problem, such as systems. Phoenix.edu states, “Rather than considering only how to solve an immediate problem, you consider how all of the pieces connect to make the whole.” (University of Phoenix, Davies & Uhles, 2024). This means that the issues should also be broken down into pieces to understand how the system works, which will help identify what may be wrong with the system.<p>
            <p>Not only is system thinking used in the development of websites, but rather it could be in any field. For example, Phoenix.edu provides multiple uses for system thinking, such as Healthcare, which uses system thinking for the improvement of patient wellness to billing process by considering social, cultural, and emotional factors based on patient health status, facilities, specialists, and demographic data.<p>
            <p>Additionally, business utilizes system thinking to build success within multiple different departments by using recycled resources, implementing requirements for projects, and/or deciding different outcomes based on what is more beneficial. Phoenix.edu state, “This approach can be applied to business situations such as: Managing airline fleet maintenance, setting flight schedules and arranging sufficient staffing, Planning a marketing campaign while also considering customer personas, budgets, legal constraints and competitors efforts, Implementing new customer-service software that may require additional employee training or reveal incompatibilities in other systems” (University of Phoenix, Davies & Uhles, 2024). These strategies can be very useful to allocate resources to departments that will most likely profit from.<p>
            <P>When done correctly, systems thinking will provide people with the ability to solve problems in a more diverse way by expanding the possibilities there are within the system. In addition, thesystemthinker.com states, “Systems thinking is also valuable for telling compelling stories that describe how a system works. For example, the practice of drawing causal loop diagrams forces a team to develop shared pictures, or stories, of a situation.” (System Thinking, Goodman, 2016). By understanding system thinking as telling a story, this can help in describing systems more in-depth and provide more details to help with solving issues. <p>
            <p>One system thinking tool that helps to identify issues within a system is called “The Iceberg” framework. The Iceberg framework is designed to stop a cycle of blame and unknown errors and help people focus on items that may be lookup over and think outside of the box. Thesystemsthinker.com exclaims, “When investigating a problem, involve people from various departments or functional areas; you may be surprised to learn how different their mental models are from yours.” (System Thinking, Goodman, 2016). This is very beneficial for people to are stuck on issues that take up a lot of their time, by forcing them to change how they go about problem solving and allowing them to think of different, more obscure issues.</p>
            <h3>Linear Thinking Vs. System Thinking</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking is much different than a more traditional way of thinking, such as linear thinking, which is a simple way of thinking. For example, linear thinking focuses on straightforward step-by-step processes for solving an issue by only looking at the issue as a problem to solve. This differs from system thinking, which questions more about why this issue is happening and what may be causing this issue. Thesystemsthinker.com states, “Linear thinking is cause-and-effect thinking: One cause has one effect. Sometimes it works adequately, as when you run out of gas and your car stops…Systems thinking provides a perspective that, most of the time, various components affect each other in various, and often unexpected, ways.” (Olthoff, J., 2016, Making the jump to system thinking).<p>
            <p>Although linear thinking is not as in-depth as system thinking, a linear way of thinking is perfect in certain situations, such as a simple problem that could be broken down easily. An example of this is “since my phone is on low battery, I should charge it because if not, my phone will die.”. On the other hand, system thinking thrives in more complex issues and finding the root causes of said issues. For example, “My phone is almost dead, I wonder why my battery is draining so fast, I have a lot of applications running on my phone, what if the charger is pushing too much power to my battery and its over exerting the full charge, it could possibly be that my software updates are too much for my older phone, or it might be because I have an iPhone 11 and the newest iPhone is a 16 with the iPhone 17 being released later this year”. This way of thinking could garnish a multitude of different ideas of what the issue may be, which can help identify a deeper problem that lies in the original issue, like the low battery on a phone.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Approach on Designing Complex Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>Lastly, systems thinking can be very beneficial in the construction of a complex digital system by using a model-based approach. This approach is most commonly known as Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE), which is a concept to identify effective tools and techniques for creating a successful system. Systems Engineering Demystified states, “A good MBSE approach will provide a set of effective tools and techniques that will enable the realization of successful Systems while managing the complexity of todays connected Systems, and allowing all relevant aspects of the System to be understood in as simple a manner as possible.” (Holt, J. 2021, Systems Engineering Demystified). By using MBSE, designing a complex digital system can communicate the needs of the user interface, functionality of the system, and the implementation of systems. For starters, MBSE utilizes 3 main concepts to complete a systems model: Approach, Goal, and Visualization. Approach will identify Frameworks that are made of Ontology, which are Concepts, Categories, or Domains; Viewpoints, what the users, stakeholders, or developers are wanting from this model; and lastly, the Process set, which is how information will be used. Secondly, there is the Goal, which will help centralize the idea that the MBSE must be developed based on the Views. Lastly, there is Visualization, which requires the creation of Notation and Diagrams to show a roadmap of what needs to be provided in the System Model to further the development of a Digital system. In addition, this can also help troubleshoot issues that may arise in the future based on the Viewpoints of users or stakeholders. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>To summarize all that has been said, systems thinking provides a helpful role in designing digital environments by allowing the developers to fully question all components of the digital environment system based on how users will interact with it, and stakeholder viewpoints, and how resources are being utilized. Different from linear thinking, which identifies the cause and effect of an issue without questioning other issues, systems thinking provides people with the ability to think outside the box and provide a more effective solution to the issue based on the entire system. This can be amplified based on tools of systems thinking, such as the Iceberg framework and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), to design complex systems, like a digital system, by implementing an Approach, Goal, and Visualization of the system.</p>

            <h3>Thinking in Life Cycles</h3>
            <p>When discussing the development of systems, especially the development of digital systems, one main concept that provides a well-structured framework is the Systems Development Life Cycle. The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that stages how systems are created, which is reliant based on the previous stage. In addition, the System Development Life Cycle is used in various different Models; from the Project life cycle, Program life cycle, and even Product Life Cycle, all life cycles use this framework to organize and effectively produce a system. The stages include.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Conception: This stage focuses on building out a requirement list of what the System needs. In addition, stakeholders are able to identify and suggest what they would like to see implemented in this system.</li>
               <li>Development: This stage involves identifying resolutions for the needs listed in the requirements and coming up with the most effective and efficient option for the system. Additionally, drafting a system will be implemented at this stage to strengthen the production phase.</li>
               <li>Production: In this stage, resolutions that are identified are implemented and created for the system. This includes trial testing that will officially determine if the system is built effectively without issues. </li>
               <li>Utilization: In this stage, end users and stakeholders will be able to use this System. This stage also includes training and examples for stakeholders to effectively utilize the System.</li>
               <li>Support: The support Stage covers the troubleshooting and uptime of the System based on maintenance, IT Help desk, or error reporting. This will ensure that users will use the System with minimal errors or faults.</li>
               <li>Retirement: Lastly, the Retirement stage provides a process for decommissioning and disposal of the system, which requires secure and timely methods.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As said in the previous section, there are a lot of examples of System Development Life Cycle models, and some of the most common models used are the Waterfall Model (Linear Model), Iterative Model, and Incremental Model. Harness.io states, “The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) encompasses various models that outline the processes involved in software development and maintenance.” (Harness Team, Seven phases of the SDLC, 2023). <p>
            <h3>Life Cycle Models</h3>
            <p>For starters, the Linear (Waterfall) Life Cycle Model demonstrates the life cycle stages in a strict order from Conception to Retirement, not straying from the order. This means each stage of the life cycle must be completed entirely before the next stage starts, which means visiting previous stages are avoided. This can prevent people from changing previous requirements and needs. Fortunately, the Linear Life Cycle model is a very simple and easy to understand model used for smaller understood projects. Additionally, this life cycle model provides a clear step-by-step process to identify which step needs to be completed. Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks that come with this life cycle model. The Linear Life Cycle model is not good for flexibility and change in projects, which means if there are errors in the future, it will be harder to fix and cost significantly more than other models. Lastly, this life cycle model is very inconsistent and doesn’t fit well with large, complex projects that require some changes throughout the life cycle. </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is the Iterative Life Cycle model, which switches from linear or single life cycle stages, since Iterative Life Cycles run through multiple times, which will improve versions with each pass through. Systems Engineering Demystified states, “The result of each iteration is a workable version of the final System that can be deployed in the target environment.” (Holt, J., Systems engineering demystified, 2023). This ensures that each cycle gets as much attention for the best results possible. Additionally, this provides stakeholders with constant feedback on the changes and improvements based on what is being identified through each iteration of the life cycle. This provides advantages, such as identifying design issues and functionality issues, which will make it easier for problem resolution. Unfortunately, the Iterative Life Cycle model takes more resources to manage and stay on schedule for stages. In addition, if determined by the stakeholders, the project may be swayed in multiple directions, causing slow downs and inconsistency. <p>
            <p>Lastly, there is the Incremental Life Cycle model, which I believe to be the best balance of changing development that stays within the objectives. Incremental Life Cycle is very similar to Iterative in the sense that Incremental Life Cycle has multiple passes, but Incremental only provides multiple passes between the Development and Production stage. This process will allow for early System release, while the System can still be worked on, allowing users to use the System early, but along with obtaining patches throughout the Systems life cycle. This life cycle is suitable for long-term projects that may take years to complete. But there are some drawbacks that come with the Incremental Life Cycle model. For starters, according to Systems Engineering Demystified, not all systems will be able to subnet into multiple smaller increments. Additionally, implementing patches throughout the life cycle of the system could be complex, which means it would be feasible to go with a simple life cycle model.<p>
            <h3>Thinking in Terms of System's Life Cycle</h3>
            <p>Thinking in terms of a system’s life cycle is important for design, sustainability, and evolution of digital systems, since systems are constantly changing and evolving. This is very important for users, companies, and other systems that are extremely reliant on the use of system development life cycle. For example, lifecycleinitiative.org states, “Life cycle approaches will help point consumption in a more sustainable direction by offering better information for purchasing, transport systems, energy sources, to guide consumers” (lifecycleinitiative.org, 2023). This also applies to the designing of digital systems, since life cycle thinking complies with stakeholders’ expectations while ensuring all applications of the design are functional and secure. Secondly, keeping the systems maintained and functional throughout its production life is important for keeping users engaged and happy, therefore upholding sustainability. Lastly, in terms of systems life cycle, evolution appears in both Iterative and Incremental life cycle models, which allows systems to change over time and resolve needs and requirements. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, the System Development Life Cycle provides a great framework for understanding how Systems are planned, developed, built, maintained, and inevitably broken down. Understanding each stage, from conception to retirement, this allows users of the life cycle to create a well-planned and effective System’s depending on what type of system is built. Additionally, System Development Life Cycle allows for clear and concise system requirements, based on user, stakeholder, and system testers. Furthermore, System Development Life Cycle provides a multitude of models, from Linear, Iterative, and Incremental life cycle models, which allows for versatility based on the project size, complexity, and resources needed for the systems. Lastly, thinking in terms of system’s life cycle allows for sustainable system design and allowing for the evolution of system designs based on the ability of change. This is important for users and organizations who rely on functional, secure, and versatile systems.</p>

               <h2>Module 2.1 Blog Post</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Human First</h3>
            <p>When entering a website, the main thing that draws attention to any user visiting, is how the website looks and how it feels. These two aspects encapsulate the user experience and how they will further interact with the website and your company. This means the way a website is developed is dependent on how users will interact with it. This is known as human centered design, where the design of a website is made based on the users needs, behaviors, and experiences with the website, which can affect design, structure, and engagement with certain processes. There are many guidelines for user interface, but almost all design guidelines and rules are based on bias, structures, and vision. Thise guideline is common in the IDEO’s field guide and the ISO 9241-210 standard. </p>
            <h3>Human Centered Design</h3>
            <p>Bias plays a big role in how users influence the design and processes of the websites since users share their experience and provide recommendations. According to Designing With The Mind In Mind by Professor Jeff Johnson, there are three factors that influence bias, which are past experience, current context, and future goals. For starters, past experiences shape the base work of how the website is modeled after and are more heavily reliant on the developer’s experiences with other websites and companies. Developers will consider these past experiences as perceptual patterns and relate them to what systems and processes should be implemented in their systems. For example, Designing With The Mind In Mind states, “Because users of computer software and websites have these perceptual frames, they often click buttons or links without looking carefully at them. Their perception of the display is based more on what their frame for the situation leads them to expect than on what is actually on the screen.” (Designing With The Mind In Mind, J. Johnson, 2021). This concept explains the reasoning of some designs, based on previous situations that feel similar to that situation.  </p>
            <p>In addition, Bias is determined by the Current Context of how the website looks and how this will attract users back to your website. For example, Dr. Johnson states “For now, I will simply say that the pattern of neural activity that corresponds to recognizing a letter, a word, a face, or any object includes input from neural activity stimulated by the context. This context includes other nearby perceived objects and events and even reactivated memories of previously perceived objects and events.” (Designing With The Mind In Mind, J. Johnson, 2021). This concept is perfect for retaining attention and keeping users from clicking off to other sites or competitors.  <p>
            <p>Lastly, when it comes to bias, a user enters a website with a goal in mind that will determine if they will continue on with their search or exit the website to find more information. These goals should be noticeable and not clustered with other information or designs that will drive away the users. For example, Dr. Johnson states “For example, when people navigate through software or a website, seeking information or a specific function, they don’t read carefully. They scan screens quickly and superficially for items that seem related to their goal. They don’t simply ignore items unrelated to their goals; they often don’t even notice them.” (Designing With The Mind In Mind, J. Johnson, 2021).<p>
            <p>As previously said, these concepts are very important for creating and maintaining user interface designs, based on how the design is to satisfy all users and how they interpret the site, easy to access information that rarely changes, and providing information that users are looking for in a easy to find location. <p>
            <h3>Perspectives of ISO & IDEO</h3>
            <p>When focusing on human centered design, both the ISO 9241-210 and IDEO’s field guide provide this approach and show a focus towards user experience and effectiveness, but they are not 100% the same. While ISO 9241-210 does focus on users, tasks, and how the web environment works, it is also very framework oriented, using a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to focus more on usability rather than design, and user thoughts. For example, Jean de La Fontaine states in Usability and User Experience Design “Whether the technical development of your system, product, or service is conducted in a waterfall model (linear approach with steps that build on and follow one another) or through agile development, you can integrate a human-centered design process.” (IDEO.org, J. de La Fontaine, 2024). This style is used for efficiency and usability throughout its life cycle. </p>
            <p>On the other hand, IDEO’s guideline focuses on creating a design for the users based on empathy and an iterate design. In addition, this guideline gathers most of its information from the users, developers, and stakeholders. IDEO.org states, “In the end, our approach amounts to wild creativity, to a ceaseless push to innovate, and a confidence that leads us to solutions we’d never dreamed of when we started. In the Field Guide, we share our philosophy of design and the seven mindsets that set us apart: Empathy, Optimism, Iteration, Creative Confidence, Making, Embracing Ambiguity, and Learning from Failure.” (IDEO.org, 2024). These guidelines can also affect how well a website works. For example, if a website was created using the ISO 9241-210 framework, there will be more functionality a login or create account page, if one was being made, but there wouldn’t be a lot of visual appealing aspects to the page. Secondly, if a login webpage was created using the IDEO guideline, there would be more visual appealing aspects that can take away from the functionality of the page.<p>
            <h3>Four UX Laws</h3>
            <p>Lastly topic to talk about is the User Experience laws that are applied to the ISO 9241-210, IDEO guidelines, and mostly all human centered designs. For starters, as said before, websites and users base their experience on a website from comparing prior websites visited. This is a common law called Jakob’s law. Laws of UX states, “Jakob’s law (also known as “Jakob’s law of the internet user experience”) was put forth in 2000 by usability expert Jakob Nielsen, who described the tendency for users to develop an expectation of design conventions based on their cumulative experience from other websites.” (Laws of UX, J. Yablonski, 2024). This is beneficial to get an understanding on what makes other websites successful and how to create a foundation of a website. Next is Fitts’s Law, which is used to create straightforward designs and interfaces, to not confuse and turn away users. This is meant to not overcomplicate systems that may lead to an influx of user leave. The third law is Miller’s law, which is used to not overwhelm users with the information given to them. With this, information is divided into “chucks” to simplify and limit the amount of information shown in the webpages. Lastly there is Hick’s Law, which is a more complex design of a website that will take users longer to find information they need, meaning keep design simple but attractive. Yablonski states, “We do this because we understand, almost instinctively, that redundancy and excessiveness create confusion.” (Laws of UX, J. Yablonski, 2024). I have concluded that these Laws of user experience (UX) were created to simplify the user’s experience without diminishing the user interface and the designs of the website. </p>

            <h3>Support User Thinking</h3>
            <p>Digital systems are a very important aspect of website and application design since this provides functionality within these systems without sacrificing the users, developers, and even stakeholders vision of the website. In addition, creating a “usable” digital system entails that a user can complete their initial goal effectively and with minimal irritation. In the previous blog post, we discussed this concept in Human Centered designs and using the 4 Laws of User Experience to create a website that is simplistic and helpful for the users who need it. We will be continuing this concept and delving deeper into how system and website designs are heavily reliant on users. From user memory and mental models for user interactions, to how user feedback is beneficial to designing a perfect website. </p>
            <h3>Memory and Models</h3>
            <p>Human memory and attention are an interesting concept that plays a bigger role in how things are created every single day. It is important to understand that humans have a very forgetful memory and short attention span, which with the invention of TikTok and Instagram reels, it is only getting worse, so when deciding what to install into a website, there must be aspects that grab the attention of the users, that also have a long lasting effect on them to remember it in the future. According to Designing With The Mind In Mind by Professor Jeff Johnson, “Because memory and attention are crucial components in people’s use of digital technology, it is important for designers of digital products and services to know something about them.” (Designing With The Mind In Mind, J. Johnson, pg. 103). This explains that catching the attention and memory of the users in digital technology, which is why it is so important for websites to have a starting page like a call to action. This will lead to more users recognizing the website and the brand and eventually stick with them as a long-term memory. Dr. Johnson states, “If a perception comes in that is similar to an earlier one and the context is close enough, it easily stimulates a similar pattern of neural activity, resulting in a sense of recognition. Recognition is essentially perception and long-term memory working in concert.” (Designing With The Mind In Mind, J. Johnson, pg. 143). Based on these aspects of creating long-term memory, users are more inclined to visit websites that have information they need, without extra information. This creates smaller websites, with little to no extra information about why the information exists and how it may be applied.  </p>

            <h3>Interface Consistency and System Feedback</h3>
            <img src="C:\Users\Donovan\Pictures\Blog 2_2\Error 404.png" alt="Error message for the system">
            <p>This leads me into my next topic, interface consistency and system feedback, which are very important for retaining users and providing them with long-term memories of your website and how to utilize it. For example, medium.com states “Imagine using an app where the navigation menu keeps changing its location, buttons have different styles and functionalities on different screens, or the color scheme shifts unexpectedly. This lack of consistency leads to confusion, frustration, and, ultimately, user abandonment.”. This consistency makes it possible to retain loyal and trustful users, and without these aspects there are times that mistakes can arise in updated designs. In addition, applying system feedback shows users where they are within the website and indicates to them that they should be doing and reduce short-term memory by reminding them of what they are doing. Interaction-design.org states, “The user should know where they are at and what is going on at all times. For every action there should be appropriate, human-readable feedback within a reasonable amount of time.” (E. Wong, The Interaction Design Foundation, 2025). This plays a big role in Tesler’s Law, that eliminates complexity in websites for users, based on feedback from the users. </p>

            <h3>Personal Experience of Poor Design</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, not all website or app designs are perfect, and some have flaws that ruin the experience of clicking on that link. For example, when entering a website, it is very unappealing to a user to have pop-ups shoved on screen which makes it impossible for users to find the information they need. I personally have a lot of experience with this happening to me and other aspects that turn me away from a website. For example, when traveling I visit many different websites to book flights, hotels, and events at said location, and I personally do not like hotel websites that give too much information, such as Hilton, which feels overwhelming to me. </p>
