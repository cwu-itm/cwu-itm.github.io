            <h3>What is System Thinking</h3>
            <p>Digital environments and how the user interface is created are a big part of the start of any website being built. From HTML to CSS, all these aspects are decided by how the programmer wants to resolve the issues users may encounter. This is most commonly resolved by systems thinking. Systems thinking is a method of identifying issues in any problem, such as systems. Phoenix.edu states, “Rather than considering only how to solve an immediate problem, you consider how all of the pieces connect to make the whole.” (University of Phoenix, Davies & Uhles, 2024). This means that the issues should also be broken down into pieces to understand how the system works, which will help identify what may be wrong with the system.<p>
            <p>Not only is system thinking used in the development of websites, but rather it could be in any field. For example, Phoenix.edu provides multiple uses for system thinking, such as Healthcare, which uses system thinking for the improvement of patient wellness to billing process by considering social, cultural, and emotional factors based on patient health status, facilities, specialists, and demographic data.<p>
            <p>Additionally, business utilizes system thinking to build success within multiple different departments by using recycled resources, implementing requirements for projects, and/or deciding different outcomes based on what is more beneficial. Phoenix.edu state, “This approach can be applied to business situations such as: Managing airline fleet maintenance, setting flight schedules and arranging sufficient staffing, Planning a marketing campaign while also considering customer personas, budgets, legal constraints and competitors efforts, Implementing new customer-service software that may require additional employee training or reveal incompatibilities in other systems” (University of Phoenix, Davies & Uhles, 2024). These strategies can be very useful to allocate resources to departments that will most likely profit from.<p>
            <P>When done correctly, systems thinking will provide people with the ability to solve problems in a more diverse way by expanding the possibilities there are within the system. In addition, thesystemthinker.com states, “Systems thinking is also valuable for telling compelling stories that describe how a system works. For example, the practice of drawing causal loop diagrams forces a team to develop shared pictures, or stories, of a situation.” (System Thinking, Goodman, 2016). By understanding system thinking as telling a story, this can help in describing systems more in-depth and provide more details to help with solving issues. <p>
            <p>One system thinking tool that helps to identify issues within a system is called “The Iceberg” framework. The Iceberg framework is designed to stop a cycle of blame and unknown errors and help people focus on items that may be lookup over and think outside of the box. Thesystemsthinker.com exclaims, “When investigating a problem, involve people from various departments or functional areas; you may be surprised to learn how different their mental models are from yours.” (System Thinking, Goodman, 2016). This is very beneficial for people to are stuck on issues that take up a lot of their time, by forcing them to change how they go about problem solving and allowing them to think of different, more obscure issues.</p>
            <h3>Linear Thinking Vs. System Thinking</h3>
            <p>Systems thinking is much different than a more traditional way of thinking, such as linear thinking, which is a simple way of thinking. For example, linear thinking focuses on straightforward step-by-step processes for solving an issue by only looking at the issue as a problem to solve. This differs from system thinking, which questions more about why this issue is happening and what may be causing this issue. Thesystemsthinker.com states, “Linear thinking is cause-and-effect thinking: One cause has one effect. Sometimes it works adequately, as when you run out of gas and your car stops…Systems thinking provides a perspective that, most of the time, various components affect each other in various, and often unexpected, ways.” (Olthoff, J., 2016, Making the jump to system thinking).<p>
            <p>Although linear thinking is not as in-depth as system thinking, a linear way of thinking is perfect in certain situations, such as a simple problem that could be broken down easily. An example of this is “since my phone is on low battery, I should charge it because if not, my phone will die.”. On the other hand, system thinking thrives in more complex issues and finding the root causes of said issues. For example, “My phone is almost dead, I wonder why my battery is draining so fast, I have a lot of applications running on my phone, what if the charger is pushing too much power to my battery and its over exerting the full charge, it could possibly be that my software updates are too much for my older phone, or it might be because I have an iPhone 11 and the newest iPhone is a 16 with the iPhone 17 being released later this year”. This way of thinking could garnish a multitude of different ideas of what the issue may be, which can help identify a deeper problem that lies in the original issue, like the low battery on a phone.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Approach on Designing Complex Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>Lastly, systems thinking can be very beneficial in the construction of a complex digital system by using a model-based approach. This approach is most commonly known as Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE), which is a concept to identify effective tools and techniques for creating a successful system. Systems Engineering Demystified states, “A good MBSE approach will provide a set of effective tools and techniques that will enable the realization of successful Systems while managing the complexity of todays connected Systems, and allowing all relevant aspects of the System to be understood in as simple a manner as possible.” (Holt, J. 2021, Systems Engineering Demystified). By using MBSE, designing a complex digital system can communicate the needs of the user interface, functionality of the system, and the implementation of systems. For starters, MBSE utilizes 3 main concepts to complete a systems model: Approach, Goal, and Visualization. Approach will identify Frameworks that are made of Ontology, which are Concepts, Categories, or Domains; Viewpoints, what the users, stakeholders, or developers are wanting from this model; and lastly, the Process set, which is how information will be used. Secondly, there is the Goal, which will help centralize the idea that the MBSE must be developed based on the Views. Lastly, there is Visualization, which requires the creation of Notation and Diagrams to show a roadmap of what needs to be provided in the System Model to further the development of a Digital system. In addition, this can also help troubleshoot issues that may arise in the future based on the Viewpoints of users or stakeholders. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>To summarize all that has been said, systems thinking provides a helpful role in designing digital environments by allowing the developers to fully question all components of the digital environment system based on how users will interact with it, and stakeholder viewpoints, and how resources are being utilized. Different from linear thinking, which identifies the cause and effect of an issue without questioning other issues, systems thinking provides people with the ability to think outside the box and provide a more effective solution to the issue based on the entire system. This can be amplified based on tools of systems thinking, such as the Iceberg framework and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), to design complex systems, like a digital system, by implementing an Approach, Goal, and Visualization of the system.</p>
