         <h3>Systems Engineering: Not Just for Software</h3>
         <p>When you hear the words “Systems Engineering” what do you imagine? A data center with thousands of systems?
            Computer architecture? While those are great examples of a System, its true scope stretches far beyond this
            more widespread understanding. In Systems Engineering Demystified, Jon Holt (2023) defines Systems
            Engineering as "a conceptual framework based on the principle that the component parts of a system can best
            be understood in the context of the relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in
            isolation” (p. 2).</p>
         <p>That definition is quite abstract and high-level. An easier way to think of Systems Engineering is looking
            at something as more than a sum of its parts. For example, a car is a system. It has multiple components,
            such as physical components (known as subsystems or system components), education, laws, regulations, and
            infrastructure, that are all designed to work together, and if looked at in isolation, its function and
            purpose start to fall a part. A cars’ brakes are a system that you can identify its function for in
            isolation, but its purpose doesn’t reveal itself until looked at as a whole. A car needs brakes to stop on
            the road without causing an accident and hurting someone. That one seemingly complete and isolated system
            actually calls upon the physical system (the physical brakes), the natural system of inertia and friction,
            and abstract systems of laws and safety regulations.</p>
         <p>While that example makes the concept of a system tangible, the true shift occurs in how we choose to think
            about it. Traditional, linear thinking is essentially a list-based approach to the world. It views problems
            as a straight line of cause and effect: if part A is broken, fix part A, and the problem is solved. This
            line of thinking assumes an implied balance that may be untouched in a simple system, but completely falls
            apart when complexity increases.</p>
         <p>In contrast, systems thinking is a mindset that shifts from looking at isolated events to identifying the
            underlying patterns and feedback loops that drive them. It recognizes that a system is is a set of things “…
            interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time” (Johnstone-Louis,
            2025). This means the relationships between components are just as important as the components themselves.
         </p>
         <p>In a digital or complex mechanical system, a linear fix often triggers unintended consequences elsewhere
            because it ignores these relationships. Systems thinking allows us to see the broader context and focus on
            root causes rather than just shallow, observable symptoms. If we only think linearly and compartmentalized,
            we risk being blindsided by change because we failed to see how our business or product relates to the wider
            web of interconnected systems.</p>
         <h3>The Pontiac Fiero: A Masterclass in Systems Failure</h3>
         <p>What happens when there is a complete breakdown of multi-discipline systems engineering? 1980s General
            Motors discovered the answer the hard way. In the late 1970s, GM faced a crisis: their “excitement
            division,” Pontiac, was not very exciting. Due to the 1973 and 1977 fuel crises and tightening emissions
            regulations, GM’s lineup was filled with heavy, sluggish cruisers. Meanwhile, small, efficient Japanese
            imports were eating away at their market share.</p>
         <p>This led to a radical idea: Project Pegasus. Later known as the Pontiac Fiero, it was designed as a
            mid-engine, two-seat car that offered the layout of a Ferrari for a fraction of the price. However, almost
            immediately, the Fiero was plagued by systemic failure from nearly every stakeholder.</p>
         <h4>The Three Evils: Complexity, Communication, and Understanding</h4>
         <p>The failure began with a lack of Understanding, one of the "three evils" of engineering identified by Jon
            Holt (2023). To get the project approved, Pontiac leadership had to "negotiate" the car's identity. They
            presented it to upper management not as a sports car, but as an efficient commuter. This created a
            fundamental conflict in Needs: Marketing wanted a sports car image to sell to young buyers, Engineering
            wanted a "performance" machine, but Accounting and Upper Management demanded a "high-MPG commuter" that
            wouldn't compete with the Corvette (Ruggieri, 2023).</p>
         <p>Because these stakeholders lacked a common language, the system boundaries were blurred. As Rick Brooks and
            Ryan Kaufman (2024) note, the systems engineer should act as the "translator" and the "negotiator" who
            adapts jargon into a common spoken language. In the Fiero’s case, the "negotiation" was a deception. The
            result was a car with a supercar silhouette but parts-bin internals: including a suspension from a Chevy
            Citation and an anemic, four-cylinder engine famously used in mail trucks.</p>
         <h4>A Marketing Nightmare </h4>
         <p>This stakeholder misalignment led to one of the greatest marketing blunders in automotive history. Marketing
            ran with its baby Ferrari look, but the constraints forced by the commuter car label meant the car was
            chronically slow. They famously touted a “50 MPG” rating to satisfy the fuel-efficiency requirements, yet
            this figure was only achievable on the absolute slowest, most stripped-down version of the car that no one
            actually bought. </p>
         <p>This is a classic example of essential vs. accidental complexity. The essential complexity of a mid-engine
            car is that it is hard to cool and also looked really cool to buyers who then demanded performance to back
            up the looks. Accidental complexity was introduced by the inefficiencies in people, process, and tooling
            (Holt, 2023, p. 15). By using a mail-truck engine and inadequate suspension and brakes from existing
            platforms to save money, GM created a system where the parts were fundamentally at war with the package.</p>
         <h4>Complexity and Firey Consequences</h4>
         <p>This leads to the final evil: complexity. To reach those high MPG goals, stay under budget, and fit within
            the constraint of a cramped engine bay, the team used a smaller than ideal oil pan. This linear decision to
            save space, weight, and cost ignored the natural system of thermal dynamics. Because the car was
            mid-engined, airflow in the engine bay was restricted.</p>
         <p>The systematic consequence was catastrophic. If an owner of a sporty car wanted to do sporty driving, they
            risked oil starvation. And because the pan was so small, this was not hard to achieve. Oil would run
            low, the engine would overheat in its cramped, unventilated box, and eventually the overstressed engine
            block would crack. This allowed oil to leak onto hot exhaust components, leading to fires. The Fiero became
            a systems nightmare because the stakeholders failed to agree on what the car was as a whole. You cannot
            change the engine and oil capacity without affecting the thermal safety of the entire vehicle, especially
            when shoehorning in a drivetrain that was never designed around mid-engine constraints. The end-user, the
            most important stakeholder, was left with a car that looked like a rocket but drove like a tractor, and
            occasionally, caught fire.</p>
         <h3>The Model-Based Systems Engineering as a Single Source of Truth</h3>
         <p>The Fiero was a victim of “siloed” information. Accounting had their spreadsheets, Marketing had their
            brochures, and Engineering had their blueprints. Because these stakeholders were working from different
            documents and points of view, a fragmented truth emerged where the deception that the car was a commuter
            rather than a sports car could live in the gaps between piles of paper. In today’s complex digital systems,
            where components are invisible and move at high speed, this fragmentation is a death sentence. This is why
            Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is applicable. It replaces disconnected documents with a single
            source of truth. In a model, every requirement and constraint is linked. If a stakeholder, like accounting
            or product managers, decides to cut costs by reducing infrastructure capacity, the model automatically
            reflects that change through the entire architecture, immediately flagging that the user experience or
            security requirements are no longer being met.</p>
         <p>As Rick Brooks and Ryan Kaufman (2024) argue, the systems engineer must be the negotiator who holds the team
            together, and in a digital system, the model is the negotiator’s strongest tool. It prevents the kind of
            “stretching the truth” that doomed the Fiero because you cannot hide a systematic flaw when a digital model
            shows a red line connecting a cost-cutting measure to a system-wide failure. Jon Holt (2023) notes that a
            model is a simplification of reality that allows us to understand these invisible relationships before they
            manifest as disasters. By modeling “what-if” scenarios, digital architects can see an escapable consequence
            before it becomes inescapable.</p>
         <h3>Legacy</h3>
         <p>The silver lining in the Fiero story is that it may not be as total a failure as popular history suggests.
            While sales plummeted from 140,000 units at its 1984 debut to just 47,000 by its cancellation in 1988, its
            lessons rippled throughout the larger GM "system of systems." Most famously, the plastic body panels the
            Fiero revolutionized became the signature feature of Saturn, a brand that successfully fought off imports
            for years by prioritizing the very stakeholder communication GM had previously lacked. The Fiero eventually
            gave GM the technical confidence to build world-class mid-engine cars, a journey that ironically culminated
            in the 2020 Corvette C8.</p>
         <p>However, General Motors as a whole also serves as a warning that tools like MBSE are only as effective
            as the culture using them. Even with the advent of modern digital modeling, GM later suffered from the
            Cobalt
            ignition switch scandal, where GM management willingly ignored critical flaws in the Chevrolet Cobalt and
            its
            platform-mates, leading to multiple deaths (Basu, 2014). This proves that technical models cannot fix a
            fundamental breakdown in the Three Evils. Systems engineering is a multidisciplinary approach that must
            include management and law (Holt, 2023). If the human stakeholders choose to ignore the flaws discovered by
            the model, the system will still fail.</p>
         <p>As a Fiero owner, the car’s flaws are baffling, yet they are a testament to the fact that systems thinking
            is the only way to bridge the gap between a "supercar" dream and the reality of a safe, reliable machine.
            Whether we are building a mid-engine sports car or a complex digital network, we must remember that if the
            stakeholders aren't on the same page, the system will eventually find a way to catch fire.</p>
